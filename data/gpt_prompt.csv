   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone","I'm truly sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Your experience with feeling worthless and being unable to rest properly sounds incredibly challenging, and it's understandable why you want to find a change for yourself. It's important to know that these feelings, though deeply distressing, are not a reflection of your true worth or value as a person. Your desire to address these feelings shows tremendous strength and resilience.

You mentioned that you have a wish to fix these issues, which is a wonderful starting point. Often, the journey toward change begins with small steps and a lot of self-compassion. It might be beneficial to explore where these feelings of worthlessness come from. Are there particular thoughts or situations that seem to trigger these feelings more than others? Understanding the root of these thoughts can sometimes illuminate ways to gently challenge and reframe them.

Remember, it's okay to seek support in this journey. Relationships, whether with friends, family, or a professional, can offer a supportive space to share these feelings. Sometimes hearing different perspectives or simply knowing you're not alone can be comforting. As you reflect on these feelings, what do you think might be a small, kind step you could take for yourself to start shifting this mindset?"
I have been feeling more and more down for over a month I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, especially with the added challenge of panic attacks and trouble sleeping. Feeling down for a prolonged period can be incredibly draining, especially when the panic attacks seem to come out of nowhere. It's understandable that not knowing what triggers these attacks can add to the feeling of being overwhelmed or out of control. I want to assure you that what you're experiencing is valid, and it's okay to feel this way. Can you tell me more about how these feelings have been affecting your daily life or how you're coping with them? Sharing everything that's going on can sometimes help us better understand the root of these feelings."
I suffer from adult ADHD anxiety disorder and depression It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician wont help I am unemployed and overwhelmed What would you suggest I do,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficulties you're facing. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and trying to manage multiple challenges can feel overwhelming, especially when it feels like you're not getting the support you need from your primary physician. Living with ADHD, anxiety, and depression can be incredibly challenging, particularly when you're also navigating unemployment and the search for a supportive healthcare provider. 

It's understandable that you might feel stuck and unsure of where to turn next. In times like this, finding ways to connect with resources that might be available to you can be really important. Have you had an opportunity to explore community resources or mental health organizations that offer support or counseling services, possibly at a reduced cost or sliding scale? Sometimes community centers or local mental health organizations have pathways to treatment that aren't immediately obvious.

I also wonder how you're coping with these feelings day-to-day. What strategies, if any, have you found helpful in managing the overwhelm and stress you're experiencing? Sometimes, even small self-care practices can add a layer of support amidst challenging circumstances. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and it's okay to reach out to different avenues as you navigate this path."
I struggle with depression as well as pretty intense mood swings throughout the month I experience highs where I feel amazing and energetic and then lows where I lack focus energy and generally have a more dark outlook on my life How can I live a more balanced life,"It sounds like you're navigating quite a challenging experience with the highs and lows you describe, and I truly appreciate your openness in sharing this. It can be tough managing the impact that such mood swings might have on your day-to-day life, as well as on your overall outlook and energy levels. It's understandable that you're seeking a more balanced experience.

Creating a sense of balance, especially while dealing with mood swings, can often begin with becoming more aware of your patterns. This awareness can help you anticipate and gently prepare for shifts in mood. Since you're feeling both energetic highs and more challenging lows, it might be useful to explore what might be contributing to these fluctuations. For instance, do specific situations, thoughts, or timing during the month seem to trigger these moods? Reflecting on these aspects can be a first step in recognizing patterns that may offer insight.

Incorporating small, consistent practices that cultivate stability and self-care can also be supportive. Is there something that generally helps soothe or ground you during the lows, or perhaps a routine that sustains your positivity during the highs? Engaging in activities that foster mindfulness, self-compassion, and connection can often provide a nurturing buffer.

How do you feel about sharing some strategies or activities that currently help you, or exploring new ones that might serve in nurturing your sense of balance? Remember, it's truly okay to take time to find what works best for you, and the goal is not perfection but rather a compassionate journey towards understanding and self-support."

How do you feel during those times when you're trying to cope, and have there been any instances when you've been able to find alternative ways to manage those difficult emotions?

The situation with your apartment manager must be really frustrating, especially since it involves something as important and supportive as an emotional support dog. Having that kind of support can mean a lot for someone dealing with mental health challenges. It’s understandable that you’re feeling upset about being told you can’t have your dog. 

While I can't provide specific advice on legal matters, it might be helpful to think about how you can open a dialog with your apartment manager.

Many people find themselves drawn to emotions or experiences that aren't immediately pleasant but might hold meaning or significance for them. Have you given thought to what you might be seeking or feeling when you immerse yourself in these sad emotions?

It's understandable to feel frustrated and disappointed, especially when your expectations and reality don't seem to align. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings can be quite overwhelming. It's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Sometimes, taking a step back to reflect on what truly matters to you can help bring some clarity. Can you recall a time when you felt more focused or fulfilled? What aspects of your life felt meaningful then? This exploration might help in understanding where this sense of being ""stuck"" is coming from, and how you might begin to navigate through it. Remember, being patient and kind to yourself during this process is vital."

"I cant even smile or fake one I cant feel happiness about anything and I cant show love towards another person not even my girlfriend I hate myself sometimes All I see is ugly
   I cant get over the loss of a loved one and Im not close to my family What can I do","I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing these difficult feelings. It sounds like you're going through a deeply challenging time, and it's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed by everything right now. Losing a loved one can leave a significant impact, often affecting our ability to connect with others and even with ourselves. It's not uncommon to feel lost or numb in these moments, where happiness and love feel out of reach, but know that you're not alone in this. Feeling disconnected from family can add another layer of isolation, making it even harder to find comfort or peace.

I want to acknowledge your courage in expressing how you feel, as sharing these vulnerable parts of yourself can be the first step towards healing. It might be helpful to explore what this loss has meant for you, and how it interconnects with how you view yourself and your relationships.

Quitting drinking can be a profound change, and it's not unusual for someone to experience a wide range of emotions, including depression. It's understandable that you're concerned about her well-being and possibly feeling anxious about her desire to move. While you might feel a strong urge to help her stay, it could be useful to focus on being there for her, whatever decision she makes, showing her that she isn't alone.

Consider having an open and gentle conversation with her about how she's feeling and what she needs right now. You could express your support and desire to understand her perspective, perhaps asking questions like, ""Can you share more about what you're feeling?"" or ""What can I do to support you during this time?"" This might encourage her to open up about her thought process and her feelings about moving.

It's also okay to share your own feelings with her in a way that helps her understand your perspective, emphasizing your care and concern for her well-being. Let her know you're there for her and willing to support her in any way you can. Sometimes just being a empathetic listener and providing a safe space for her emotions can be incredibly helpful."

It's understandable to seek out new ways to find relief, and you're certainly not alone in wondering if counseling could be beneficial. Many people find that a combination of medication and therapy can provide a more comprehensive approach to managing their mental health. 

Counseling, especially when rooted in evidence-based approaches like Dialectical Behavior Therapy, can offer a supportive space to explore underlying emotions, identify patterns in your thoughts and behaviors, and develop coping strategies. It can also help in understanding the various factors contributing to how you're feeling. Just having a dedicated time and space to talk about what's going on for you can be incredibly validating and healing.

How do you feel about the idea of exploring counseling as a complement to your current treatment? What are you hoping to gain from such an experience? Your insights into your needs and feelings will be instrumental in shaping an approach that truly supports you."

It can be deeply unsettling when you find yourself in situations where, on paper, everything seems right, yet emotionally it feels as though something crucial is missing. Having people who care about you and provide for your physical needs is incredibly important, but the feeling of not truly belonging or ever feeling ""at home"" is profound and can evoke a sense of loneliness or displacement. I'm here to listen, and I'm interested in exploring these feelings with you. What do you think contributes to this sense of not belonging, especially when you're with those who care about you? Are there particular moments or experiences that amplify these feelings for you?"

It seems like you're in a challenging situation where you see someone you care about struggling but are unsure of how to help, especially when they aren't open to seeking help or discussing their feelings. Your observations about your friend's feelings of emptiness and predominant emotions of anger and sadness are insightful, and it's clear you want to support him in the best way possible. It's important to continue being a supportive presence in his life. Sometimes, just knowing that someone is there to listen and provide support can be incredibly valuable, even if he isn't ready to open up just yet. Have you tried exploring what makes him feel this way, or creating a safe space where he might feel comfortable sharing more when he feels ready?"
Ive become so jaded that I cant control my thoughts I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of overwhelming feelings, and I can imagine how difficult that must be for you.

Anxiety attacks can be especially distressing, and it’s understandable that these experiences might heighten feelings of being out of control. 

I want to assure you that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to acknowledge how consuming these emotions can be. Trying to regain a sense of focus and peace can be difficult during these times, but talking about what you're going through is a great step towards understanding and managing these feelings. 

What do you think might be contributing to these jaded feelings and anxiety attacks? Exploring what might be underlying these feelings could be a helpful place to start."

Feeling lazy and numb can be profoundly challenging and it may make day-to-day life seem more difficult. It's understandable to feel this way, and I'm here to support you in exploring these feelings. Numbness often serves as a protective mechanism, possibly signaling that you're overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I wonder if there are any specific moments or experiences that seem to trigger these feelings for you, or if there have been changes in your life recently that might be contributing to this sense of disinterest? It might be helpful to gently explore what your mind and body are trying to tell you. You're not alone in these feelings, and I'm here to listen as you navigate them."

When two close friends, who are integral parts of your life, move away, it can indeed leave a void and make you feel quite alone. It’s understandable that their departure would have a significant impact on your emotional well-being, possibly contributing to feelings of loneliness or even a sense of depression. These feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge that this is a difficult adjustment period.

Making new friends can sometimes feel daunting, but it can also be a wonderful opportunity to connect with new people and find activities or communities that bring joy and support into your life. Perhaps reflecting on activities or hobbies you enjoy could be a starting point. Joining a class, a club, or an online community related to your interests might introduce you to like-minded individuals. I'd be interested to hear more about things you enjoy or any thoughts you have on how you might begin to connect with others.

It can also be helpful to consider what made your friendships with your previous friends meaningful. This can provide insight into the kind of connections that might be fulfilling for you in the future. You've shown strength by reaching out and expressing these feelings. That's an important step forward. How do you usually cope with feelings of loneliness or sadness when they arise?"

The situation you're describing seems overwhelming and painful, and it can be so hard when you feel blamed or like a source of conflict.

I'm curious to hear more about your perspective on why you feel like you're the cause of these situations. What do you think might be contributing to these feelings?

Remember, it's important to find a kind of support system, whether it's talking to someone you trust or finding a safe space to express these emotions.

Feeling depressed and anxious often, with only brief periods where things feel alright, can be incredibly taxing on both your mind and body. It seems like picking at your skin might be a way you're trying to cope or manage some of these intense feelings, even if it isn't something you're doing consciously. This pattern of starting conflicts to introduce change might also be a way your mind is seeking some form of relief or variation from the routine of these emotions. 

It's completely understandable to want change or some kind of shift when you're feeling trapped in negative cycles. I'm curious about what the picking and causing conflicts might be communicating to you about how you're feeling inside. Exploring what triggers these behaviors could be a step towards understanding what you really need in those moments. What kind of situations typically precede these feelings of anxiety and the need to pick at your skin or engage in conflict, and how do you feel during and after these episodes?

"Im in my late teens and live with my dad The only time I go out is for my college classes Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks    Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right
   Are they right am I depressed","It sounds like you're navigating a lot of complicated feelings, and I want to acknowledge how challenging that can be. It's understandable to have moments where your desire to connect with friends fluctuates, and those feelings of worthlessness or doubt about your future are hard to sit with. Often, these emotions can lead us to question ourselves and wonder what they might mean. You are not alone in experiencing these kinds of thoughts, and it’s important to remember that feelings can ebb and flow for many reasons. 

When you say you're unsure if you're worth knowing or if you're going to do anything right, it reflects the deep inner conflict and maybe some self-critical thoughts that many people experience at different times in their life, especially during times of transition and change. I'm really glad you reached out to express these feelings. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed these feelings, or if there are any specific situations that seem to trigger them?

"She has trouble falling and staying asleep and shes always either extremely hungry or not hungry at all She also gets angry and feels like crying really easily for no reason She says she is always kind of down
   Is this depression What can I do to help her","It sounds like she is going through a difficult time with these intense feelings and physical symptoms. Having trouble with sleep, changes in appetite, mood swings, and feeling down can indeed be overwhelming for both her and those around her. It's really wonderful that you want to help her, which shows a lot of care and compassion. While I cannot diagnose, I can certainly help navigate this conversation.

One of the most important things you can do is to offer her a supportive and non-judgmental presence. Let her know that you are there for her, ready to listen whenever she's comfortable opening up. Sometimes, simply knowing someone is willing to hear her out without judging or immediately trying to fix things can be incredibly comforting.

You might gently encourage her to consider seeking professional support, as talking to a therapist could help her explore these feelings further in a safe environment. In the meantime, you can encourage small, manageable steps that promote self-care, like regular walks together in nature, practicing mindfulness, or setting up a routine for sleep and meals. Each small step can build a sense of structure and routine, potentially providing some stability during this time.

If you're comfortable, you could ask open-ended questions that invite her to share more about what she's experiencing. For example, ""Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're having trouble sleeping?"" or ""What do you think might help when you're feeling especially down?"" These questions may help her to articulate her feelings more clearly, possibly identifying any underlying issues. Remember, simply being there and showing empathy can be a significant source of support."
"Im a teenager and I I go through periods of moodiness I have extreme feelings but I bury them and then I feel nothing  just empty and emotionless
   I have trust issues low self esteemban extreme fear of abandonment and I constantly reevaluate my relationships I also dont know who I am as a person Im not happy overall but Im not suicidal Can I just feel happy","Thank you for sharing what you're experiencing; it sounds like you're going through a lot right now. It can be really challenging to navigate such intense feelings, especially when they fluctuate and leave you feeling empty at times. Experiencing moodiness, extreme emotions, and concerns about trust and self-esteem can be particularly tough during the teenage years, a period often filled with significant change and self-discovery. It’s understandable that you’re feeling confused about your identity and the nature of your relationships.

Your fear of abandonment and the constant reevaluation of relationships suggests that trust and stability are really important to you, which is completely valid. These fears can impact how you perceive others and yourself, making the search for happiness feel elusive. While wanting to feel happy is very natural, it's also important to acknowledge all the different emotions you're experiencing. They are telling us something about your needs and desires that are very real and valid.

It might help to explore what happiness means to you and what small steps could lead you towards moments of joy, even if they're fleeting at first. Have you found anything that brings you a sense of peace or contentment, even if it's something small or brief? Understanding these moments can foster a deeper connection with yourself over time. Let's talk more about what these feelings might be saying about your deeper needs. How do you typically cope with these intense emotions, and are there any moments where you feel a sense of relief or understanding?"
My mother is combative with me when I say I dont want to talk with her about my depression    She hasnt been supportive of me in the past and she isnt someone that I feel comfortable opening up to She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I dont want to or cant answer I tell her I dont want to talk and she starts arguments with me    How can I get her to understand,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and discomfort in your interactions with your mother, especially around the sensitive topic of your depression. It's understandable that you might feel hesitant to open up, particularly if past experiences with her have not been supportive. It can be challenging when someone close to us doesn't seem to respect our boundaries or understand our needs. I hear that you're wanting to communicate your feelings and boundaries in a way that she can understand, without it leading to arguments. 

One approach might be to express your feelings to her in a calm and clear manner, perhaps during a neutral time when neither of you is feeling triggered or defensive. You could try sharing how these conversations make you feel and why it's important for you to handle your mental health in your own way. It might help to use ""I"" statements, focusing on your feelings, such as ""I feel uncomfortable and upset when I am pushed to talk about my depression because I need space to manage it."" This way, the focus is on your feelings, rather than on her actions, which might help reduce defensiveness.

Additionally, reinforcing your boundaries might be necessary, even if it feels repetitive. It can also be beneficial to reflect on what makes you feel safe and supported and consider sharing that with her, if you feel it's appropriate. I can imagine this situation feels exhausting and perhaps disheartening at times, and I'm here to listen if you need to explore this further. How do you feel about creating that kind of conversation with your mother?"
I just feel sad all the time and I dont like anyone in my family I feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Those feelings of persistent sadness can be incredibly overwhelming, especially when you feel a lack of understanding or control in your relationships with your family. It sounds like there's a tension between your desire for independence and the dynamics at home, which might be contributing to your feelings. Could you share a bit more about what’s been happening with your family that makes you feel like they're trying to control you? Understanding the specific situations or behaviors can sometimes help in finding ways to express your needs in a way that encourages healthy communication and growth."
I know I need to deal with my depression But I dont know how and I dont want to tell anyone    How can I deal with depression without telling anyone,"It sounds like you're grappling with a significant challenge and the desire to manage everything on your own. First off, I want to acknowledge how tough it can be to feel this way and also to consider seeking help. It's understandable to have reservations about sharing personal struggles with others, and it's important to move at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

One thing that might be helpful is to start by gently exploring your feelings and acknowledging what you're experiencing. Writing in a journal or using creative outlets like art or music can sometimes provide a safe space for expression. It might also be helpful to engage in activities that are known to boost mood, such as regular physical exercise, spending time in nature, or doing things you enjoy, even if they don't seem as appealing right now.

Practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques can also be beneficial. These practices can help in managing overwhelming feelings and bring a bit of calmness into your daily routine. Breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditations can be a good start.

While it's understandable that sharing might feel intimidating, I encourage you to consider if there might be even one person in your life with whom you could express some of what you're feeling. Sometimes just opening up a little can ease the burden. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking even small steps toward understanding your feelings is a significant move forward. How do you feel about trying some of these small steps on your own?"
Im dealing with an illness that will never go away and I feel like my life will never change for the better I feel alone and that i have no one    How can I overcome this pain and learn to be happy alone,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Living with a chronic illness can be incredibly challenging, and it's understandable to feel weighed down by it. It sounds like you might be feeling trapped or isolated by this experience, and those feelings can be very overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge the pain and frustration that come with it. You're allowed to feel these emotions, and you don't have to face them alone.

Exploring ways to find moments of solace or even joy amidst the challenges can be helpful. This might mean finding small activities that bring you comfort or connecting with nature or art in a way that feels meaningful. Sometimes, seeking connection with others who understand what you're going through, like support groups or communities facing similar challenges, can foster a sense of belonging and understanding. When you're ready, reflecting on what truly matters to you may also help guide you toward what might bring some peace or fulfillment.

I wonder what small steps you might consider taking to feel less alone or to find a bit of happiness in your day-to-day life. Is there something you used to enjoy that you might want to explore again, or some form of connection that you think might be supportive for you?"
I feel like I am internally screaming all the time Externally I am calm but I have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly I dont feel sad I dont cry a lot I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming It kind of feels like Im a caged animal,"It sounds like you're experiencing a powerful and overwhelming internal sensation that doesn't quite have a label, and that can be challenging to navigate. Feeling like you're internally screaming while maintaining a calm exterior might create tension between how you appear to the world and what you're experiencing inside. The imagery of feeling like a ""caged animal"" conveys a sense of being trapped or confined, stuck with these intense emotions and unsure how to release or express them. It's understandable that this could leave you feeling emotionally distant or disconnected. I'm here to listen and explore this with you. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed these feelings, or any situations where they become more apparent? What might be contributing to this sense of being inside a metaphorical cage?"
I dont know how else to explain it All I can say is that I feel empty I feel nothing How do I stop feeling this way,"I'm really sorry that you're experiencing this sense of emptiness. It sounds like there might be a lot going on beneath the surface, and sometimes these feelings can be challenging to put into words fully. Feeling nothing can often be as overwhelming as feeling too much. It can be frightening and isolating, and it's okay to acknowledge that. Have you noticed if there are specific times or events that might influence these feelings of emptiness? Understanding when and how these feelings are most present might help us explore them further together. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s important to give yourself permission to feel whatever is coming up for you, even if that's nothingness right now."

It's important to acknowledge how courageous you are in facing these emotions and trying to make sense of them amidst such complexity. Your sense of uncertainty about your identity amidst all this is also a significant part of your experience. Can you share more about what feels important to you as you navigate these emotions? Or perhaps, what aspects of yourself you’re exploring in this journey of understanding your past?"

It's commendable that you're reflecting on your experiences and trying to understand the patterns that have contributed to your feelings over the years. It seems like the intense pressures and expectations in college might have reignited some of those difficult emotions, leading to actions you now regret, like self-harm. It’s important to recognize that your past actions don’t define you, and acknowledging regret is part of the healing process.

You mentioned that you often feel overwhelmed by stress, which then escalates into feelings of hopelessness and depression. This cycle of stress can make it tough to see a way forward, especially when it feels like you're overreacting or impacting your relationships with loved ones. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it can certainly be challenging to break out of that pattern. I'm here to explore these feelings with you.

It can be really disheartening to put in effort and not see the results you hoped for. 

I want to assure you that your feelings are completely valid, and reaching out for help shows a lot of courage. It's important to remember that healing is often a journey, and what works for one person might not work for another.

It may be helpful to explore what having respect for a decision looks like for you and what respecting your own needs and feelings looks like as well.

It can be really challenging when you feel like you're not getting enough quality time with someone you care deeply about, and it's natural for that to lead to feelings of resentment, especially when there are other factors like his responsibilities to his children. It's important to recognize that your feelings of stress and sadness are valid and might be signaling a need for change or conversation.

You mentioned that these feelings sometimes lead to breaking down easily and experiencing depression, and that sounds very difficult to navigate. It might be helpful to explore what quality time means to you and how that aligns with the current relationship dynamics. How do you feel about discussing these feelings with your boyfriend?

Sometimes, it can be helpful to explore the demands on your time and how you're feeling in those moments.

It's important to acknowledge the courage it takes to keep stepping into these situations despite the fear and anxiety they bring. The pressure to perform and provide for your family can be overwhelming, and it's understandable that these experiences are leading to feelings of humiliation and depression.

In this space, it's essential to validate your emotions and recognize that it's okay to feel this way. You're not alone in this, and many people face similar struggles with employment and self-worth. What you've been through doesn't define your capabilities or your potential. You mentioned feeling paralyzed and unsure, which can often be tied to the fear of negative outcomes based on past experiences.

When you mention feeling disconnected even when you're physically close to your family, it seems there might be a longing for deeper, more meaningful connections or interactions. It's understandable to feel adrift when there isn't much structure or engagement in daily life. And while it can be comforting to have one friend, it might also feel limiting or lonely if you're hoping for more social interaction.

How do you feel about the possibility of reaching out more, whether it's to your family, by finding activities or hobbies that interest you, or possibly exploring new social opportunities?"

Crying on Wednesdays seems to be a recurring pattern, which might indicate something particular about that day for you.

The feelings of loss and longing you've been experiencing are understandable, especially when you had envisioned a future together. It's not uncommon for the end of an important relationship to linger, affecting emotions and daily life in profound ways. It seems like this relationship was an integral part of your life, and its absence has left a void, possibly contributing to the depression you're experiencing.

Dealing with a breakup can be incredibly challenging, and it's important to acknowledge the depth of what you're feeling. It's okay to still have love and care for someone even after a relationship has ended. These emotions don't simply switch off, and it's natural to carry them with you as you navigate the healing process. You've mentioned feeling unable to connect with others, which can often accompany such a significant emotional period. This may be because the depth of your past connection feels unmatched, or perhaps it's challenging to be open to new possibilities while still holding onto the hopes from the past.

Focusing on self-compassion during this time can be crucial. Allow yourself to feel what you need to feel without judgment, and try to gently explore these emotions. What was it about this relationship that felt so special to you, and what parts of it do you miss the most? Reflecting on these questions can sometimes offer insights that help us on our path to healing.

Remember, it's okay to take your time with this process. Everyone heals at their own pace, and that's perfectly valid. If you find yourself needing additional support, reaching out to a therapist can offer a safe space to further explore these feelings and learn ways to manage them. You're not alone in this journey."

What are some moments or instances where you've managed to navigate or cope with these feelings, even if it's in the smallest way?"
I dont know how to have emotions I never had any from my birth Being human I think of myself as a monster I enjoy pain I cut myself for my climax during sex I think most of the time I lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth I was in rehabilitation for four year I have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions The books that I enjoy reading HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe I go hunting every Saturday I feel powerful I dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,"Thank you for sharing your experiences and feelings with me. It sounds like you're going through a complex and possibly confusing time where you're trying to understand your emotions and behaviors. When you mention feeling devoid of emotions and finding sensations through pain, it's understandable that this might lead to some distress or confusion about your identity. Your interests in certain types of literature and activities like hunting seem to offer you feelings of power and perhaps a connection to experiences that might otherwise feel out of reach.

It's important to recognize that seeking sensation and understanding oneself can look different for everyone, and there’s no judgment here about where you currently find those moments or what they mean to you. Your journey is unique, and it sounds like you have gone through significant experiences, including rehabilitation, which might have been an important part of your life so far. I'm curious about what your experiences during rehabilitation were like for you and if there were any moments or insights you gained from that time that felt significant.

Your mention of lying, even when unnecessary, suggests there might be underlying emotions or thoughts that are difficult to express or confront directly. Sometimes, habitual behaviors can develop out of a need to protect oneself or manage experiences that feel overwhelming. Would you be interested in exploring what might be happening beneath these habits?

Overall, it seems that you're trying to make sense of an inner world that might not align with external expectations or typical experiences. It’s okay to sit with these feelings and reflect on them without judgment. What are some things you hope to understand or change about your current experiences?"
I am on my own with my daughter I am so worried and stressed about her,"It sounds like you're carrying a heavy responsibility on your own, and it's understandable to feel worried and stressed about your daughter.

Balancing the responsibilities and emotions of having a newborn, while also navigating the complexities of your current living situation, must feel overwhelming at times. Your resilience in seeking support from the women's home and planning for both housing and childcare shows a lot of strength. It’s understandable to feel isolated too, especially when you can’t see your boyfriend as often as you might like. What have been some of your thoughts or feelings about this transition period in your life? It's a lot to handle all at once, and it's important to acknowledge the weight of what you're experiencing."
I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back This past time it was extremely debilitating so I went on Wellbutrin I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week A month and a half later I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away However I still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and I have days where I feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine,"It sounds like you've been going through a challenging journey with your mental health and have taken some thoughtful steps towards managing your depression, including trying medication. It's understandable that you're reflecting on how Wellbutrin may have impacted your ability to engage with the root causes of your feelings and behaviors. You're finding a balance between medication and personal growth, which can be a delicate and deeply personal process.

You mentioned feeling okay since stopping the medication, yet you still experience days of feeling disconnected or unable to fully concentrate. It's important to recognize the complexity of depression and how it interacts with our sense of self and daily functioning. Finding fulfillment and regaining a sense of self can often require both time and intentional, supportive strategies like adopting good habits or seeking additional therapy.

Have you considered speaking with a therapist about these experiences? Engaging in therapy can provide a space to delve deeper into those feelings of ""zombielike haze"" and explore underlying thoughts and behaviors without judgment. This might help in regaining a sense of self and identifying new paths for fulfillment.

Could you perhaps share more about the good habits you're implementing? Sometimes exploring these habits in detail can bring awareness to what's helping or highlight areas that could benefit from change. You're already taking steps by being mindful and making thoughtful decisions, and it's okay to seek support during this process."

You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to acknowledge how deeply it impacts you. These feelings can sometimes feel isolating, but reaching out and expressing them is a significant step.

Feeling like you want someone to love and someone to love you in return is a very human need. Relationships can provide a sense of comfort and belonging that can be immensely fulfilling. It's also understandable that when you don't feel this connection, it can lead to darker thoughts. How long have you been experiencing these feelings, and are there moments when they intensify or feel more manageable? Exploring these patterns might provide some insight into your experiences.

You deserve to be heard and to have a space to express what you're going through without judgment. It might be helpful to reflect on when these thoughts arise and consider what might be triggering them. Can you think of times in the past when you felt more connected or loved, and what were those circumstances like? Understanding the context can sometimes offer clues about what might help you now.

Please remember, reaching out for support and connecting with others, whether through friends, support groups, or therapeutic settings, can be very powerful. It might not change things overnight, but having someone to listen and understand can make a difference."

It’s common to feel overwhelmed or anxious in crowded situations, and it seems like this is having a profound impact on you.

First, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to open up about something that can feel very private and difficult. It seems that this behavior might be your mind's way of responding to strong emotions or stress, especially in light of experiencing anxiety and a challenging past. It's important to approach this with self-compassion and a non-judgmental attitude towards yourself.

Our bodies and minds often develop ways to cope with overwhelming emotions, even if those ways aren't always the most helpful or safe. The key here is to start exploring these patterns with kindness and curiosity. Recognizing when you feel the urge to engage in this behavior can be a helpful starting point. Have you noticed any specific triggers or emotions that seem to precede these episodes? Sometimes, finding new ways to manage or express those feelings can be a step towards change.

Engaging in practices like mindfulness can also help increase your awareness of when this behavior occurs and can potentially create a pause before acting on the impulse.

You mentioned wanting to be ""normal,"" and I imagine that desire comes from a place of wanting relief and a sense of belonging or stability.

It's possible that your mind is trying to process certain emotions or experiences, and it might be doing this through your dreams. 

It's okay to not have all the answers right now about why you're having this dream or why you can't remember it fully.

I am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism We try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen so we just talk in a calm voice However other kids see the treatment as unfair,"It sounds like you're navigating a challenging situation with a lot of care and thoughtfulness. Working with children with autism can require different approaches to ensure they feel comfortable and supported, and it's clear that you're trying to create a positive environment for everyone involved. Using cards to help redirect focus is a wonderful strategy, as it offers a calming distraction that can help manage his behavior. It's understandable that the other kids might see this difference in treatment as unfair, especially if they don't fully understand the reasons behind it. 

Children are often very perceptive and might be picking up on the differences without grasping the underlying needs that necessitate those differences. It might be helpful to frame this as a learning opportunity for them about empathy and understanding diversity. Encouraging discussions about how everyone has unique needs and strengths could provide the other children with some insight. How have you been able to talk about these differences with the children, and how could engaging them in these conversations change their perspectives? Remember, you're also learning alongside them, and each step you take is an opportunity for growth not just for the child in question, but for everyone involved."

It's not uncommon for parents to have different levels of attachment or connection with each child, especially when considering the varying demands and stages of development each child requires.

It's worth acknowledging the incredible strength and resilience you've demonstrated as a single parent. That hard work and dedication have likely played a role in the opportunities your children have today. 

At the same time, it’s natural to reflect on the past and wonder if things could have been different. It’s important to remember that every family dynamic is unique, and the foundation you provided has influenced the paths your children have taken.

"My daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparents house She wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself
    We also have a new baby in the house i didnt know if this would contribute to this How should I approach this","It sounds like you're navigating a challenging situation and it's understandable to feel concerned when your daughter expresses such intense emotions. It's important to acknowledge that her behavior may be a reflection of her distress, possibly exacerbated by fatigue and the recent changes at home, such as the introduction of the new baby. Children can sometimes express emotions in a heightened way when they are tired, overwhelmed, or experiencing major changes in their environment. 

By approaching her with empathy and understanding, you can create a safe space for her to express how she feels. It might be helpful to talk with her during a calm moment, perhaps during a quiet time when she feels more relaxed. You could gently ask her about how she's been feeling lately, and what it was like for her at her grandparents' house when she felt upset. Inviting her to share, without judgment or immediate problem-solving, can help her feel heard and supported.

Also, exploring how the new dynamics at home might be affecting her could open up a conversation. She may be experiencing feelings she's not sure how to articulate yet. Offering her reassurance of her place and value in the family during this transition could help. Remember to validate her emotions, letting her know it's okay to feel upset, but also guiding her to find words to better understand those feelings. Encouraging her to express herself through drawing, talking, or playing can be useful. 

Through regular and gentle check-ins, you can continue to offer her your support and understanding. If you find that her expressions of distress remain intense or frequent, it may be beneficial to explore additional support options together. Remember, it's okay to seek guidance when navigating such complex emotions."

It's understandable that you might feel worried about how this type of experience could affect him. It can be difficult as a loved one to witness situations that may seem unfair or confusing for a child. While I can't provide advice on what steps to take, it might be helpful to reflect on your feelings about this situation. How do you perceive the potential impact on your grandson, and what are your thoughts and emotions about his stepmother's actions? Exploring these feelings could help you navigate your thoughts and determine if there are additional ways to support your grandson."

It sounds incredibly painful to be in a situation where someone you care about is making you feel this way, and I can understand why you feel the need to distance yourself. Feeling worthless or like you're being constantly put down can really drain your emotional energy and affect your well-being. 

It's important to acknowledge these feelings and recognize that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Your desire to move out makes sense as a step towards finding a more peaceful and supportive environment. Have you been able to talk to anyone in your life about how you're feeling, like a friend or a family member who you trust? Finding someone to share your experiences with might offer some relief and perspective on your situation. 

Additionally, reflecting on how these experiences are impacting you and what steps might be available can empower you as you consider your options.

Wanting to live with your mom and maintaining open communication with her seems very important to you, but there’s also the fear of upsetting your dad and dealing with his anger. It seems like you're balancing a lot of heavy emotions and responsibilities, which can be really overwhelming.

Acknowledging your feelings is crucial here. It’s okay to feel scared about how your dad might react, and it's also okay to want to seek a living situation where you feel more comfortable and understood. Have you been able to talk to anyone else about how you're feeling, whether it's another family member, friend, or perhaps a counselor at school? Having additional support might help you work through your thoughts and feelings surrounding this decision.

When pondering how to communicate this to your dad, it might be helpful to focus on expressing how you feel—a perspective that centers on your experience rather than attributing blame. You might start by sharing your feelings honestly, perhaps something like, “Dad, I've been feeling really torn and overwhelmed because living here has been hard for me.” This might open the door to a more empathetic discussion.

It’s also vital to take care of yourself through this process. What are some things that bring you comfort or help you feel a little more at ease when things get tough? Reflecting on these aspects might provide some relief during this difficult decision-making time. Remember, your feelings are valid, and seeking a situation where you feel secure and happy is an understandable, important goal."

It’s important to acknowledge the emotions both you and your daughter are going through right now. It might be helpful to approach this situation with compassion for yourself as well as for her, recognizing that rebuilding trust and connection can take time and patience. 

Have you had an opportunity to reflect on what your daughter might be referencing when she talks about ""remembering things from the past""? Sometimes understanding her perspective can be a crucial step in beginning a conversation about healing. Opening a dialogue, when she’s ready, about how she feels and what she might need from you moving forward could be beneficial. What are your thoughts on ways you might create a safe space for such conversations, even if they're initially difficult? Remember, it's okay to seek support from a therapist for yourself as you navigate these emotions. This could provide a space for you to gain insight and reflect on ways to communicate effectively with your daughter and ensure that you are both on a path toward healing."
Shes a teenager and for the last two years shes lived with her older brother Shes angry because she wants to come live with me but my current living situation is not the best for her She refuses to see any reason Shes being disrespectful Her sexual curiosity is waking up,"It sounds like you're facing a complex and emotionally charged situation, and it's understandable that you'd be concerned about how to navigate these dynamics with your daughter. It's not easy when the ones we love are struggling, and you're trying to manage this with the added pressure of your current living situation. Teens can often express their emotions through strong reactions, like anger or disrespect, which may be their way of communicating overwhelming feelings or unmet needs. Her desire to come live with you suggests that she craves a connection or reassurance from you, and that's an important piece to acknowledge. 

Her sexual curiosity is a natural part of development, and it makes sense that you’re concerned about how to address that in a way that respects her growing independence while still considering her safety and values. I wonder how this topic has been discussed between you, and if there are opportunities for open, judgment-free conversations where she can express her feelings and you can share your concerns. How have previous discussions with her about your living situation played out? It might be important to explore ways to keep communication channels open so that she feels heard, even if she doesn’t get the answer she’s looking for right now.

Your feelings are just as important in this equation, and I’m curious about how all this is affecting you. What support do you have for yourself during this time? Remember, creating small moments where you both can connect positively, even amidst disagreement, can often lay the groundwork for more understanding down the line."
I told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again She started crying because I wouldnt make her daddy die,"It sounds like you had a difficult conversation, and I can imagine it must have been intense for both you and her. Your intention might have been to explain a complex topic in a way she could understand, but it's natural for a child to feel upset when faced with the idea of losing a loved one. It's understandable that she's reacting emotionally to something as significant as this. Feelings of fear or sadness about the possibility of losing someone important can be powerful and overwhelming, especially for a child trying to process such an abstract concept. How are you feeling after having that conversation, and what do you think might have helped ease the intensity of the moment?"

Raising an adolescent can indeed be tough, especially when it involves complex issues such as weight and respect. It must be stressful and concerning for you and her father, particularly as you want the best for her. It’s understandable to feel at a loss sometimes. Adolescence is a period filled with changes and figuring out personal identity, and many teens may push boundaries as they navigate this phase.

Understanding more about her perspective might help us explore ways to encourage a dialogue that fosters understanding and mutual respect."
He is an adolescent He has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video We have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment but after a few months of having then back he pees his pants again,"It sounds like you're really concerned about how to address this situation with empathy and understanding, and it's clear that you're looking for ways to support your son through this challenge. It's not uncommon for adolescents to get deeply immersed in activities that they enjoy, such as video games, and sometimes that immersion can lead to difficulties with recognizing physical needs, like using the bathroom in time. It can be frustrating when the strategies you've tried don't seem to have a lasting impact, and it's understandable that you're seeking new approaches to help him.

One important aspect to consider is the significance of creating a supportive environment where your son feels comfortable expressing any feelings he might have about his experiences. It might be helpful to explore this issue with him in a way that focuses on understanding rather than punishment, as this could lead to a deeper insight into why this pattern continues. You might consider asking open-ended questions to encourage him to share more about how he feels when he's playing games, and whether there are moments when he notices the urge to use the bathroom but struggles to act on it.

It seems you care deeply about his well-being and are committed to finding a solution that works for him. By working together and exploring this situation as a team, you might uncover underlying factors that could be influencing his behavior, which can then guide you both towards practical solutions that are supportive rather than punitive."
Is this something I should be worried about Should I do something about it,"It sounds like you're experiencing some uncertainty or concern about a particular situation, and that's completely natural.

We are the legal guardianship of our grandson He has been acting out and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year How are we to handle this,"It sounds like you are navigating a very challenging situation with your grandson, and I want to acknowledge the care and concern you have for him and his well-being. When a child is acting out, it's often a way for them to express feelings that they may not yet have the words for or fully understand. The desire to talk to his mom may be linked to a deep longing for connection, understanding, or closure. It's important to approach this situation with open communication and to try to create a safe space for him to express his feelings.

Consider starting a conversation with him where he feels comfortable sharing what he's experiencing. You might ask open-ended questions like, ""What would you want to say to your mom if you could talk to her?"" or ""How do you feel when you think about reaching out to her?"" These questions can help him reflect on his emotions and give you insight into how he's processing the relationship with his mom. It's essential to acknowledge his feelings and validate them, even if they are difficult or painful.

At the same time, it might be useful to explore ways he can cope with these feelings of longing or uncertainty. Encouraging activities that help him express his feelings, like drawing, journaling, or talking through role-play scenarios, can be beneficial. Through these compassionate interactions, you are offering him a sense of safety and support, which can be very comforting during these challenging times."
My brother just broke up with his girlfriend While they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother Now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us How should we approach the situation Is she doing the right thing for her child,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging situation, and it's understandable that you would miss the connection you've had with her son over the past two years. It seems like you've formed a meaningful bond with him, and her decision may feel sudden or perhaps even confusing. It's important to acknowledge the sense of loss this situation might bring for both you and your mother, and to process those feelings.

From her perspective, it might be an effort to create boundaries after the breakup, which is a decision she likely feels is in the best interest of her child, even if it's difficult for others who have been involved. It's a tricky balance between honoring your connection with the child and respecting her parental rights and decisions. Have you had a chance to express your feelings to her directly or discuss the possibility of maintaining some contact? Maybe sharing how much you valued your time together could help, and see if there's a way to come to an understanding that respects everyone's needs.

Ultimately, maintaining open lines of communication could bring more clarity to her choices and might help you and your family adjust to this transition. Exploring how you and your brother are handling the situation can also be beneficial. How are you feeling about the loss of this connection?"
My exhusband told my two adolescents that Santa doesnt exist on the day before Christmas They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas but I dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real I dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but I also dont want to lose their trust,"It sounds like you're in quite a challenging situation, trying to navigate maintaining your children’s holiday magic while being honest with them. It’s understandable to feel caught between wanting to preserve their childhood wonder and the desire to build a relationship based on trust and honesty. This must be quite difficult for you as a parent, especially since you want to support them in holding onto the joy and excitement of the season. It might be helpful to explore how your children are feeling about this revelation and what the magic of Christmas means to them. You might consider asking them what aspects of the holiday are important to them and how they feel about what their father said. By focusing on their feelings and perceptions, rather than the factual question of Santa's existence, you create an opportunity for a conversation about what magic, belief, and tradition mean to them. This can help them find a sense of autonomy in deciding how they want to perceive the holiday, potentially allowing both the joy and the trust you value to coexist. How do you feel about opening this type of dialogue with them, and what are some of your thoughts on navigating these complex emotions?"
For the last year my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting Im at my wits end How can I get them to stop and get along,"It sounds like you're dealing with a very stressful situation at home, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when your children are constantly fighting. Conflicts among siblings can be incredibly taxing, both emotionally and physically, draining your energy and patience as you try to manage everything. It's common for siblings to have disagreements, but the constant fighting can leave you yearning for some peace and a closer relationship between them.

Have you had a chance to talk with each of them separately about how they're feeling and why these conflicts might be arising? Sometimes understanding the underlying emotions or triggers for their arguments can be a helpful starting point. It might also be useful to consider how they might react to being a part of the problem-solving process. Encouraging open communication where each of them can express how they feel could foster more empathy and understanding. 

Reflecting on these dynamics, how do you feel about approaching the situation in a way that encourages dialogue and understanding between them? Your concern for their relationship is evident, and finding a path to guide them towards a healthier and more respectful interaction might be a gradual process, requiring patience and compassion both for them and yourself.

My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training He almost throws up every time he sees his poop He gags and will not go on the toilet We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it When he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress,"It sounds like both you and your toddler are going through a challenging time with toilet training, which can often be a complex and emotional journey for little ones. It's completely understandable to feel concerned when you notice your child is experiencing fear and stress related to such an essential part of their development. First of all, it's important to acknowledge that every child has their own pace when it comes to learning new things, including using the toilet. It can be helpful to approach the situation with patience and understanding, realizing that this fear your toddler has when seeing poop is common among young children.

One strategy might be to try and make the process as neutral and positive as possible. Since your toddler seems to have a strong reaction to seeing their poop, consider exploring ways to normalize it. This could be through playful, age-appropriate storytelling or even using books that explain the process in a fun and friendly way. It sounds like you are already showing him where poop goes by dumping his diaper contents into the toilet, which can be a helpful step in familiarizing him with the bathroom process.

It's also important to observe if there are specific triggers that cause anxiety or if there are moments of success that you could celebrate—sometimes creating a little reward system for every attempt or showing enthusiasm can encourage participation and reduce fear. Additionally, it might help to have casual, relaxed conversations with him when he's away from the bathroom to figure out what might be concerning him in simple terms that he can express. 

Try to trust his natural maturity process, allowing him to learn at his own pace, and continue to offer gentle encouragement without pressure. Remember, support and patience during this process are key, and over time, with lots of empathy and understanding, he is likely to gain the confidence he needs to overcome his fear. How do you feel about the strategies you’ve tried so far, and do you think anything might be helpful from what we discussed?"

Regret can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when it involves someone who means so much to you. It's clear that your love for this person and your children is incredibly important to you, and that you are willing to do what it takes to make things work. It's understandable to feel worried about the future and the impact it may have on your family dynamics, particularly when there are children involved.

These feelings might also be bringing up anxiety or fear about changes you can't control, which can be overwhelming. You've expressed a strong desire to be present in your children's lives, and that's a testament to your commitment and love for them. It might be helpful to explore more about what specifically hasn’t been working for you and what changes you wish to make. How do you feel about the current situation, and what aspects do you wish were different? Reflecting on these aspects might provide some clarity on the steps you might want to take moving forward. Remember, it's okay to reach out for support, whether that be through friends, family, or a professional, as you navigate these emotions and find a path that feels right for you and your family."

It's completely okay to feel this way, and reaching out to talk about it shows a lot of strength and self-awareness. It might be helpful to start by exploring where these feelings are coming from. What are some situations or experiences that seem to trigger these thoughts? When we understand these patterns, we can begin to challenge them and gradually shift our perspective. 

Self-acceptance is a journey, and it's often about recognizing your intrinsic worth beyond any imperfections or mistakes. Practicing compassion towards yourself, much like you would with a close friend, can also be a helpful approach. Consider what you might say to someone you care about who feels the way you do, and try applying that same kindness to yourself. Additionally, reflecting on your strengths and achievements, no matter how small they might seem, can sometimes help build confidence.

Remember, it's okay to take small steps here, and there's no need to rush. If you're comfortable, I'd love to hear more about your experiences or any thoughts you're having right now, so I can better support you through this process."

Dealing with stress from school, alongside the pain from being bullied for such an extended period, can take a significant toll on your mental and emotional well-being.

It sounds like you were in a situation where you felt exposed and perhaps even judged, which can be really tough to navigate. Embarrassment is a natural reaction when we feel like we've been put on the spot or when something unexpected happens that makes us self-conscious. It's important to remember that how you feel matters, and your comfort should be a priority in any environment, especially one where you're learning and training.

Would you like to talk more about how this experience affected you? Maybe we can explore how you're feeling about continuing with the class or if there are other emotions this situation might have stirred up for you."

It can be challenging to navigate these situations, especially when you have concerns about how others perceive you.

Perhaps it could be helpful to consider what aspects of these feelings are most significant to you. Is it the fear of your friends' reactions, or the way you view yourself? Reflecting on these questions might offer some insight. It’s also worth considering what you value most about your friendships. Often, our friends care about who we are rather than how we look. 

If you feel comfortable, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation with a close friend about how you’re feeling.

It's important to acknowledge just how painful it can feel when these negative self-perceptions take hold.

Can you share a bit more about what might have led you to feel this way? It's perfectly okay to unravel these thoughts at your own pace, and I'm here to listen and explore them with you."
I hate everything I see in the mirror I dont like being in pictures and always scribble out my face Its stressing me out I dont trust my parents enough to tell them and I dont know what to do,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of distress when it comes to your self-image, and I want to acknowledge how hard that must be for you. It’s understandable to feel hesitant about sharing these feelings with others, especially if trust is a concern. Trust is such a fundamental aspect of relationships, and it can be difficult when you don’t feel like it’s there. Being unhappy with how you perceive yourself can be incredibly challenging and can affect how you interact with the world around you.

In these situations, it’s important to have a safe space where you can express what you’re going through. Reflecting on what specific thoughts or feelings arise when you look in the mirror or at photos might help you understand more about where these feelings are coming from. If you feel comfortable, maybe consider discussing these thoughts with someone you trust, such as a close friend or a counselor at school. Sometimes, expressing our thoughts out loud can begin to lighten the load we carry inside.

What kinds of feelings or thoughts come up for you when you consider the idea of speaking to someone about this?"
Whether its to a guy or girl I always feel insecure talking and I am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough Even when I am walking I worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,"It sounds like you’re feeling quite a bit of self-consciousness in social situations, and this can be really challenging to deal with. Feeling insecure about how we present ourselves and worrying about being good enough is something many people experience, and it can create a lot of anxiety. Your concerns about things like appearance and facial expressions show a significant awareness of yourself, which might feel overwhelming at times. It's important to remember that these feelings and worries are valid. You’re trying to navigate interactions in a way that feels safe and comfortable for you, which makes a lot of sense. 

I wonder if there have been specific experiences that have contributed to these feelings of insecurity when interacting with others. It might be helpful to explore what these interactions mean to you and how they've impacted your self-perception. How do you usually feel after these interactions, and are there any moments when you’ve felt more confident or comfortable? Exploring these experiences might help in understanding and eventually easing some of that worry, step by step."

Watching someone you care about struggle with alcohol and self-esteem issues can be tough, especially when it places a burden on you. It's clear that you care about her well-being, but it also seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure to manage her emotions, and perhaps even her safety. Her constant seeking of validation and reassurance, especially following drinking episodes, might be overwhelming for you. It seems like there's a balance you're trying to maintain between supporting her and taking care of your own emotional boundaries. How do you feel about the role you're currently playing in her life, and how is it impacting you personally?"
I always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people I know that no matter what I do or how I change there will always be some people who hate me Why do I feel this way,"It's understandable to feel the pressure to impress those around you, whether it's family, peers, or others in your life. This can often stem from a desire for acceptance, validation, or a sense of belonging. Many people go through periods in their lives where they feel the need to be liked or approved of by others, and that need can sometimes overshadow their own true feelings or desires.

It sounds like you're aware of how this need affects you and that you've identified there will always be varying opinions about you, regardless of what you do. That awareness is important. Sometimes, this drive to please can be rooted in deep-seated beliefs about your self-worth or fears around rejection and judgment. It's worth exploring why these feelings might be particularly strong for you. 

Reflecting on whether there are certain situations or people that intensify this need to impress could be helpful. Are there specific expectations you feel you must live up to? Also, consider what it would be like for you if you focused more on being authentic to your own values and interests, rather than trying to mold yourself to fit the expectations of others. What feelings might come up for you when you think about being accepted just as you are?"
I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down Its ruining my mood and even my whole self I have trouble sleeping and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me,"It sounds like you're experiencing an incredibly difficult and overwhelming time right now, and I'm genuinely sorry to hear that you're going through this. It seems like you're feeling quite isolated and maybe even under attack, which must be incredibly distressing. Sleep is such an important part of our wellbeing, and dealing with sleep paralysis on top of everything else can make things feel even more unmanageable. You mentioned feeling like others are mocking and judging you, which must feel really isolating. It’s understandable that these experiences would impact your mood and sense of self.

It's really important to acknowledge that these feelings don’t make you pathetic, stupid, or worthless.

I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now In the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating We argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work I used to party a lot and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else These situations were never more than just kissing I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me I love him so much and want to work things out too but Im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me I cant seem to forgive myself Im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness,"It sounds like you've been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that feelings of guilt and unworthiness can weigh heavily on you. Acknowledging what happened and your openness with your boyfriend is a significant step, showing a lot of courage and your commitment to making things work. It's important to remember that forgiveness, both from others and for oneself, can be a complex and deeply personal journey.

Your boyfriend’s decision to forgive might come from a place of genuine love and a desire to move forward together, which can be an encouraging foundation to rebuild trust and understanding. However, forgiving yourself might take more time, and that’s okay. It’s natural to feel conflicted when you’re trying to reconcile your actions with your values and how you see yourself.

Exploring what makes it difficult for you to forgive yourself might be a helpful step. What do you believe forgiving yourself would mean, and how does it align or conflict with your sense of self? Reflecting on these questions might open space for more self-compassion and understanding. It might also be helpful to consider how you and your boyfriend have grown both individually and as a couple through these experiences.

Engaging in self-compassion exercises and focusing on the positive changes you’re making could help you move toward a place of forgiveness and acceptance. What are your thoughts around taking those small steps to practice self-compassion, and how do you think these might impact the dynamic of your relationship moving forward?"

It takes a lot of courage to reach out and express these struggles, and I am here to listen and support you through this. You're doing your best to cope with intense emotions, and it's understandable that you're seeking a way to manage them, even when the behaviors turn harmful. Feeling stuck in a cycle like this can be incredibly frustrating and isolating.

I wonder, could you share more about what happens before you notice these urges to self-harm or drink? Understanding the moments that lead up to this can sometimes shed light on underlying thoughts or emotions that might be contributing to these actions. It seems like when healthier outlets backfire, such as exercise leading to an asthma attack, it makes things even harder. How does this impact your motivation or perspective on finding other coping strategies?

I'm here to support you in exploring ways to approach these emotions and behaviors with more compassion and understanding. It's important to acknowledge that seeking help and support from a counselor or therapist could provide a safe space to explore these feelings deepened, offering a guide through the complexities.

Feeling like you don't measure up to others, whether it be in terms of intelligence or appearance, can be incredibly isolating and distressing. It's completely understandable that you might feel overwhelmed.

What you're experiencing are deeply challenging emotions, and it's important to recognize that you're not alone in these feelings, even if it seems like no one else is experiencing them. Many people, especially during adolescence, can struggle with similar thoughts and concerns, even if they don't openly talk about it. It's crucial to be kind to yourself and know that it's okay to have these feelings. 

I wonder what it would be like to explore more about what you feel when you compare yourself to others. And perhaps, consider if there is someone you trust—maybe a friend, family member, or counselor—you could talk to about these feelings. Sometimes, sharing how you feel can lighten the weight of those emotions a little bit.

Feeling like you're losing someone you care deeply about can be incredibly painful and confusing. It sounds like you're experiencing a wide range of emotions right now, from sadness to hope, and perhaps uncertainty about the future. Wanting to reconnect and maintain a relationship with someone who means so much to you is completely understandable.

   How can I get myself to just move on","I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing such a difficult emotional situation. It's understandable that you're feeling torn between your heart and your mind, especially when those profound feelings have been significant in your life.

Navigating the space between what you deeply feel and what you think is the right thing to do can be incredibly taxing, both emotionally and mentally.

It's understandable that you're struggling to comprehend his conflicting behaviors, especially when they are compounded by his existing diagnoses. Relationships, particularly those involving complex mental health issues, can often be fraught with paradoxes and conflicting emotions.

From what you've described, it seems like your spouse's statements and actions may reflect his internal struggles, which can manifest in confusing ways. His jealousy and claims about your feelings could be a projection of his own emotions or insecurities. It's not uncommon for someone to experience a mix of resentment, fear of abandonment, and longing for connection, which can be expressed inconsistently.

While it might be helpful to try to understand his behavior, it's just as important to center your own well-being and emotions in this difficult time. How are you feeling amidst all of this?

It's understandable to feel such deep remorse when reflecting on past behavior, especially if you recognize that it contributed to her unhappiness. It seems like you're becoming more aware of how your actions may have impacted the relationship, which is an important step in your own personal growth.

It must be difficult to hear that she needs time and space to process her feelings, especially when you're ready to take steps to make amends.

Trust, once compromised, can be incredibly difficult to rebuild, especially when the situation involves such sensitive dynamics. Your feelings of doubt and uncertainty are completely valid, considering the weight of the revelation and the time it was kept from you. It's important to clarify what trust means to you and whether you're receiving the reassurance you need to feel secure in your relationship.

In moments like these, self-compassion can be a vital part of your healing process. It may also be beneficial for you to find support, whether that be through trusted friends, family, or a professional who can offer guidance as you work through these emotions. Looking at everything you’ve been through, how have you been coping day-to-day, and what support or self-care options have you been considering or already seeking?

Sometimes, identifying these can help in developing coping strategies that work for you.

Therapeutic support can also be a valuable space for this kind of exploration, where you can process experiences in a way that feels safe and supportive.

Surviving childhood abuse can leave lingering emotional scars, and it's not uncommon for people who have endured such experiences to have strong reactions to certain types of physical touch. It seems your girlfriend might be feeling triggered, which can happen when current situations evoke memories or sensations from past trauma, making someone feel as if they're reliving, in part, those distressing experiences.

What she's feeling is valid and real, and it's important to approach this with empathy and understanding. Creating a safe and supportive environment for her to express her feelings without judgment can be very beneficial. It could be helpful to ask her open-ended questions to understand how she feels comfortable in the moment and what kind of support she desires. Additionally, encouraging her to communicate her boundaries and feelings about touch can help you both navigate these situations in a way that respects her needs and maintains emotional safety.

It's important to realize that these feelings are valid, and you're not alone in experiencing them. Many people find it beneficial to explore where these emotions might be originating from. Have there been specific events or relationships that you feel have contributed to them?

One approach could be to reflect on these feelings in nondirective ways, which might involve writing in a journal or talking with someone you trust to help identify underlying patterns or triggers. You might also benefit from exploring these thoughts and emotions further through mindfulness exercises, which can help bring awareness to your current emotional state without judgment.

Could you share more about what typically triggers these feelings for you, or how they manifest in your everyday life? Reflecting on these aspects might provide us with more clarity on how to navigate through them together. Remember, it's okay to take your time with this process, and I'm here to support you as you explore these emotions more deeply."

It's understandable to feel upset when someone in your life isn't showing the consideration and respect that you feel is necessary, especially within the shared space of a home.

I can imagine that experiencing such strong feelings, which lead to physically expressing your anger by throwing things, might be overwhelming and confusing. It's important to remember that feeling emotions intensely can be quite common, and it doesn't necessarily mean you have a problem. Everyone has different thresholds and coping mechanisms for stress, and it seems like maybe something else could be contributing to these reactions.

It makes sense that you're feeling unsure of how to cope with these complexities. I want you to know that it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed or even fearful in this situation.

Watching someone you care about engage in self-destructive behavior can be deeply unsettling.

It sounds like he's going through a really tough time with these intrusive thoughts and dreams. It's important to acknowledge how brave he is for opening up to you about what's happening in his mind. Having such violent thoughts and dreams about loved ones can be incredibly unsettling, and he might be feeling a lot of anxiety or fear around them. 

You mentioned that he says these thoughts ""just pop up,"" which suggests they feel uncontrollable to him, adding to the distress. It might be helpful to consider that sometimes our minds generate thoughts that are quite contrary to our values or what we want, and this can be particularly distressing as we struggle to comprehend them. 

Perhaps encouraging him to reflect on any underlying fears or stressors that might be contributing to these thoughts might be beneficial. How does he feel about these thoughts and dreams? Are there particular situations or feelings that seem to precede these episodes? Understanding the context might offer some clues, and sometimes discussing these fears out loud helps to lessen their hold. 

You're in a strong position to provide a supportive ear, offering him reassurance that these thoughts don't define him as a person. Let him know that he's not alone in these experiences, and you're there to support and understand him through this. What emotions or thoughts come up for you when he shares these experiences with you? It might be helpful for both of you to explore these feelings together."

It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when surrounded by intense emotions, especially if you're perceiving that anger has become more prominent in your life since your partner's presence. The awareness you're showing about the situation and wanting to change it for the sake of your girls is an important first step. 

It's okay to feel frustrated about reacting in ways that don't align with how you see yourself. These reactions might be reflections of the stress and tension in your environment. You're not alone in this, and many people experience similar shifts in their emotional responses due to their surroundings. You've shown tremendous strength by reaching out and acknowledging these feelings.

I'd love to hear more about what ""your old self"" means to you. What are some qualities or behaviors from the past that you miss and wish to bring back into your life?

Not being able to sleep, carrying around a sense of anger, and feeling disconnected from the ones you love can be overwhelming. It seems like you're aware of how these feelings are affecting your interactions with your son, and that awareness is an important step in making changes. It also seems like there might be an underlying reason your emotions are building up this way. 

Feeling unable to open up to your family, despite that desire, must be really isolating. It's understandable to feel frustrated and alone when communication isn't going the way you wish it could. What would it be like if you could express some of these feelings to your family? Or maybe there's a safe space we can explore here together where you could begin to unpack where these feelings might be coming from. How do you feel about what's happening with your sleep and your emotions? Maybe we can explore how these experiences are connected to what's going on inside."
My issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor It causes violent thoughts but I never act I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent not me I dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment,"It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by such intense anger and to recognize that it feels disproportionate to the situations triggering it. It sounds like you're experiencing a formidable internal struggle, where your anger is almost like a wave threatening to sweep you away, yet you're holding onto the understanding that these feelings do not define who you are. This awareness is an important step in managing these emotions. You mentioned a fear of being submerged in anger and resentment, and it makes sense to want relief from feelings that can be so consuming.

It can be really challenging when you feel like your emotional responses are impacting not just your relationship with others, but with yourself as well. It's great to hear that you're motivated to make changes and to seek happiness and grace in your reactions. 

You're not alone in experiencing strong emotions that sometimes feel out of control, and it's a positive step that you're reflecting on your actions and wanting to improve. It might be helpful to explore what specifically triggers these emotional responses and what feelings are underlying your anger. Often, intense emotions like anger can stem from feelings such as fear, hurt, or insecurity. By identifying and acknowledging these feelings, you might begin to understand your reactions better and choose different responses in the future. 

You mentioned wanting to be better for yourself and those you love. Reflecting on what being ""better"" means to you could be a valuable exercise. How would you describe the version of yourself that you aspire to be? What qualities does this person have and how do they interact during challenging moments? Exploring these questions might help you set specific goals and develop strategies to practice more intentional responses. Remember, change takes time and self-compassion is key. You're taking an important step by recognizing these patterns and seeking growth. How do you feel about this journey you're considering, and what are some small steps you might take toward these goals?"
I dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger Thats really the only one i feel,"It sounds like you're really tuned into feeling anger, and it’s understandable that it might seem like the predominant emotion you’re experiencing. Anger can be powerful and all-consuming, making it difficult to notice other feelings that might be present. It’s not uncommon for people to find expressing emotions other than anger challenging, as it often masks more vulnerable feelings like sadness, fear, or hurt. 

Recognizing that you want to explore and express other emotions is an important step in itself, and it shows a desire for deeper self-awareness and growth. Do you ever notice anything different physically, like changes in your body or tension, when you're experiencing what you identify as anger? Sometimes, paying attention to these signs can help uncover other emotions. How do you feel about taking the time to explore these feelings more fully, perhaps in a way that feels safe and gradual for you? Remember, there’s no rush, and it’s perfectly okay to take things at your own pace."

It sounds like you're experiencing an intense mix of emotions right now, and that can be really overwhelming. It can be distressing when anger and possessiveness seem to take over, leaving you feeling out of control. It's important to remember that these feelings don't define who you are; they're signals that something might be needing your attention. 

Feeling possessive over someone who isn’t yours could indicate a deeper need for connection or control, and it's worth exploring what that relationship means to you. Similarly, the urges to harm someone may be a manifestation of underlying pain or frustration. It is crucial to find safe and healthy outlets for these emotions, as acting on such urges could be harmful to both you and others.

Can you tell me more about what typically triggers these feelings for you? Understanding the context might help in exploring these emotions further. Remember, you're not alone in this, and seeking support is a strong and positive step towards understanding and managing these feelings."

It's understandable that acknowledging these feelings would make you feel even more overwhelmed, especially if it feels like they're constantly just beneath the surface. What you're describing sounds like a cycle where anger feeds into itself, which can be incredibly difficult to break. It might be helpful to explore the underlying feelings or situations that might be contributing to this persistent anger, as sometimes there are deeper emotions, such as hurt or fear, that express themselves as anger. I'm here to support you as you navigate these feelings, and I wonder if there are particular triggers or situations that you've noticed tend to exacerbate your anger, or if there are moments where you feel relief from it? Sometimes, sharing these experiences and what surrounds them can provide insights that might be less apparent when you’re in the midst of intense emotions."

It sounds like these emotions and behaviors are really affecting you, and it's understandable that you would want to make sense of them. It's great to hear that you have supportive relationships in your life, but it can be confusing and frustrating when you're feeling intense anger that seems out of proportion to the situation. It’s important to recognize that feeling anger is a normal part of being human, but it seems like the intensity and the ways you’re expressing it might be causing you some distress.

It sounds like you've found some ways to redirect that energy and avoid damaging your surroundings, but it also sounds like these methods might be harmful to you. I'm really glad you've stopped cutting, and it's worth considering ways to manage this anger that might be more compassionate to yourself. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that occur before these feelings of rage arise? Sometimes, just starting to track when these emotions come up can offer some insights into any underlying issues or unmet needs that might be driving these reactions.

I also want to emphasize that you're not alone in this, and reaching out for additional support—like talking to a counselor or therapist—can be incredibly beneficial. They can help you explore these feelings more deeply and work on strategies to manage them. Have you ever tried any techniques to calm yourself when you start feeling this way, or is there anyone in your life with whom you can talk about these experiences? Exploring these questions might help you feel more in control and supported."
I have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month,"It sounds like you've been experiencing quite a distressing time with those nightmares persisting for such a long period.

The sensation of repetitive swallowing combined with an out-of-body feeling might understandably lead to some anxiety or concern. It's important to remember that bodies can react in complex ways that aren't always fully understood on the surface. Even though your doctor has reassured you that your benign brain tumor isn't associated with these symptoms, it makes sense to seek understanding and peace of mind about what's happening. How do these experiences impact you, emotionally or otherwise, and are there particular thoughts or feelings that come up for you when they occur? Opening up about your experiences might help in identifying any patterns or triggers that could provide further insight."
Ive pretty much been on my own since day one Im a middle child of five and I cant seem to put my trust in anyone It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone I freak out and never talk to them again I really want some help,"It sounds like you've had quite a journey navigating relationships and trust, especially coming from a large family where you might have felt overlooked at times. It's understandable to feel guarded when trust seems difficult to achieve. The fact that it took you time to open up to your best friend suggests how important it is for you to feel safe and understood before you can let someone in. It might feel overwhelming when emotions get intense, and it's natural to react by pulling away if that feels like a safer option. I’m curious to hear more about what comes up for you when you start to develop feelings for someone. What does that experience feel like, and how do you navigate those emotions?

"For some reason I feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media I know she is proud of her body and I respect that but I dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does
   Anytime I bring it up to her she thinks Im calling her a whore How can I deal with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media and not hurt her feelings","It sounds like you're experiencing a situation that is causing you some discomfort, and you're also invested in maintaining a healthy and respectful relationship with your girlfriend. It's understandable to have feelings of discomfort, especially when those feelings challenge how you want to express mutual respect and appreciation within your relationship. It seems you value her happiness and confidence, yet there's a part of this situation that's difficult for you to reconcile with. 

When you approach this conversation with her, focusing on how you feel rather than what she is doing might open a more understanding space. You could share your feelings and insecurities without framing them as her actions being ""wrong"". For example, rather than emphasizing her actions, you could talk about how the situation impacts you personally, and ask her how she feels when she shares those posts. This could lead to a deeper conversation about each of your perspectives, expectations, and the values you hold regarding appearances on social media. 

Would you like to explore what specific feelings these situations bring up for you? Identifying these feelings might help you communicate more effectively with her, keeping it clear that your feelings are not an accusation but rather insights into how you’re navigating your own emotions in these scenarios."
He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault he bashes me to our young child and he is addicted to a few substances,"It sounds like you're facing a really challenging and painful situation. Being blamed for conflicts and having your character questioned in front of your child can be incredibly hurtful and distressing. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when dealing not only with the tensions in these fights but also with concerns about substance use and its impact on your family. Your feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge the strain such a dynamic can place on you emotionally. Reflecting on what's happening, how are you currently managing to cope with these challenges on a day-to-day basis? Your well-being and that of your child are so important, and finding a supportive environment to explore these feelings and situations could be immensely beneficial."

It can be tough when family responsibilities and obligations seem to take precedence over your personal relationships, and it’s understandable that this has led to some tension and little fights between you. It's great to hear that both of you want to work things out. Wanting to address the issue is an important first step. I'm curious about how you and your partner feel when you face these issues.

I went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide When I went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that I put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders He was very angry that I went to him to do that Am I in the wrong for going to him to reach out He helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why I thought of him to reach out He made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help Why did he react this way towards me I think hes being selfish,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging situation and feeling a mix of emotions, perhaps confusion and a bit of frustration, stemming from your ex-boyfriend's reaction. It's understandable that you reached out to someone who has been supportive to you in the past, especially in difficult times. It can be disheartening when someone you thought would understand reacts differently than expected, especially when your intentions were to help someone in need. 

Your ex-boyfriend’s reaction might have been intense because reaching out to someone experiencing a crisis can be overwhelming, and maybe he felt unprepared or stressed about the responsibility. There may be a variety of reasons behind his response, like feeling unequipped to help someone in a crisis or possibly being overwhelmed by the emotional weight of the situation. It’s not uncommon for people to react out of stress or fear in situations like these, but it's also important to acknowledge your feelings of hurt and disappointment.

Have you had a chance to talk to him about how his reaction made you feel? Sometimes open, empathetic communication can help both parties understand each person's perspective more thoroughly. How are you feeling about the situation now, and is there anything specific you're hoping to achieve in terms of communication or resolution?"
He told me he started to back away because I was asking for too much in the relationship The more I tried to fix things the worse it got I want to make us better again but I dont know how,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging and emotionally draining experience in your relationship, and it's understandable to feel unsure about how to move forward. The feeling of wanting to repair things and make them better is a natural response, especially when you care deeply for someone. It must be difficult to hear that your partner feels overwhelmed by what you've been asking for. This situation can bring up a lot of emotions, like confusion, frustration, or even hurt, especially when your intentions were to improve the relationship.

It might be helpful to explore what ""asking for too much"" means in the context of your relationship. Sometimes, different perspectives on needs and expectations can lead to misunderstandings. How are you feeling right now about your partner's response and the dynamic you've been experiencing? Taking some time to reflect on those feelings might give you some clarity. Remember that relationships are a dance of give and take, and communication plays a key role. What are some ways you've found that help you feel connected to your partner or convey your needs without feeling overwhelmed? Your thoughts and feelings are important, and they deserve space to be explored in a supportive and understanding environment."
My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide He says that because his dad died so did his heart He says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again Why is he doing this when we were very happy together He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult time. It sounds like your boyfriend is experiencing a deep and intense emotional struggle after the tragic loss of his father. When someone we love is enduring such profound grief, it can often impact their ability to engage in relationships as they once did. His words about feeling like his heart died too probably reflect how overwhelmed he is with grief, and his decision to distance himself might be his way of coping with the intense emotions he's experiencing.

It seems important to acknowledge that his decision to end the relationship isn't a reflection of anything you did or didn't do, but rather, a response to his current emotional state. Grief can be incredibly isolating, and sometimes people feel the need to shut others out because they don't know how to handle their own feelings or how to navigate support from loved ones during such a tumultuous time.

As you process this, it might be helpful to give yourself space to feel whatever emotions arise—whether it's sadness, confusion, or even anger. Emotions during times like this can be complex. How are you managing with all these changes? What kind of support do you have around you? It might be beneficial to reflect on these questions, offering yourself the same compassion you're extending to your boyfriend."

It's difficult when communication seems blocked and you feel like you're left in the dark about what's happening on his end. It's understandable to want clarity and to feel heard and valued in your relationship. I wonder how these interactions affect you emotionally. Do they make you feel disconnected, frustrated, or maybe even something else? It can be valuable to identify your feelings to better understand what you're experiencing. If you're comfortable, I'd like to hear more about how these behaviors impact you and your thoughts on the situation."
My husband cheated while I was pregnant with our son with a socalled friend This was before we were married We split and eventually worked things out I thought I trusted him so we got married Now he flirts with girls in front of me Ive talked to him but nothing helps,"It sounds like you are dealing with a very painful and complex situation, and it's completely understandable to feel hurt and betrayed by your husband's actions, both in the past and currently. The trust that you’ve worked hard to rebuild seems to be at risk again, and that can be incredibly challenging and painful. It's natural to seek reassurance and respect from a partner, especially after having already gone through a significant breach of trust.

I can imagine the confusion and frustration you might be feeling, having communicated your feelings to him and still not seeing any change. It might feel as though your emotional boundaries are being tested, and it's important to acknowledge how draining this can be. Your feelings are valid, and wanting to be in a relationship where your partner is respectful and considerate of your feelings is entirely reasonable.

Reflecting on what's important to you in this relationship could be a valuable way to deepen your understanding of your needs. How does it feel when these conversations with him happen? What kind of response are you hoping for from your husband? Exploring these questions might help you better communicate your feelings and needs to him. This situation calls for a safe space for you to explore your emotions, and remind yourself of the worth and value you bring to this relationship."

It can be difficult when past issues resurface during conversations, especially if she's already feeling stressed with her work responsibilities. It’s understandable that you might feel frustrated or hurt when you perceive that family isn't her priority. 

Let's focus on how you're feeling about these interactions. Have you noticed any patterns in when or how these conversations arise? Sometimes, it can be helpful to reflect on the emotions and thoughts that come up for you during these times. How do they affect your relationship?

Im in love with my own gender and my parents are against that I dont know how to tell them because Im afraid theyll not want me anymore,"It's understandable that you're feeling apprehensive about sharing such a significant part of your identity with your parents, especially when there's a fear of rejection. The fear of not being accepted by those we love can weigh heavily on us. Your love and feelings are valid, and it's important to honor your authentic self in the way that feels right for you. Approaching this situation requires courage, and it's okay to feel unsure about the timing and the way to have this conversation. It's also okay to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being.

How you choose to share your journey with your parents is deeply personal and can depend on many factors, including the nature of your relationship with them and their current attitudes. Sometimes, reflecting on what you hope to gain from the conversation can help shape the approach you take. It could also be helpful to consider seeking support from a trusted friend, a support group, or a counselor who can offer guidance and a safe space to express your feelings.

It sounds like you're feeling caught between wanting to protect your family from going through pain and navigating the complicated emotions tied to what you've witnessed. It's understandable to feel an array of emotions, such as anger, confusion, or even sadness, given the circumstances. This is a significant burden to carry, and it makes sense that you're not only worried about your parents but are also trying to figure out what your role should be. 

Engaging in another conversation with your mother could be an avenue to express how this situation is affecting you personally. Keeping the discussion centered on your feelings may help her understand the impact her actions have had on you, rather than focusing solely on what she's done. Reflecting on what's most important to express can guide your approach if you decide to speak with her. 

Remember, you don't have to manage these feelings alone. If possible, reaching out to a trusted person outside of this immediate situation for support can be beneficial. How do you feel about reaching out to someone for further guidance or support as you navigate this emotional landscape?"

Managing a relationship alongside mental health challenges can indeed be complex and emotionally taxing. It takes a lot of compassion and patience to support someone who's struggling, especially when it affects aspects of daily living, like employment. It's important to recognize the strength it takes to remain supportive while also acknowledging any feelings of frustration or concern you might have.

I keep being mean to my best friend and I dont know why all the time I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time Could that be a cause,"It's really insightful that you're starting to make connections between how you feel treated by your mother and your behavior towards your best friend. This kind of reflection can be very challenging but also incredibly valuable for personal growth. It's possible that the dynamics with your mother are influencing how you interact with others, including those you care about deeply. Sometimes, when we experience certain patterns in one relationship, it can unconsciously affect how we relate in other relationships. How does it feel to consider this might be happening in your life? Are there particular situations with your friend that seem to trigger this behavior, or do you notice any specific feelings that arise beforehand? Exploring these questions might help you gain more clarity and compassion for yourself in navigating these complex emotions."

It's understandable that you're struggling with the concept of forgiveness, especially when the wounds from the past still feel present. Forgiveness can be a deeply personal and often complicated process, and it's okay if you're not ready to forgive just yet or to express it directly to her. What's important is acknowledging your feelings—whether it's hurt, anger, or disappointment—and allowing yourself the space to process them without pressure. How do you feel about the possibility of simply sitting with these feelings for a while, without the expectation to act on them right now? This might be a useful step toward understanding what forgiveness means for you in this context."

It seems like you're longing for a positive and harmonious connection, which shows how much you value this relationship. When disagreements happen, it can sometimes feel overwhelming, as you might be trying to balance expressing your own feelings with maintaining a peaceful dynamic.

It's understandable to feel that way, especially when someone you were close to seems to be pulling away. It's not unusual for relationships to shift and change as people grow and enter different phases of their lives, but that doesn't make it any less hard to deal with. Feeling left out can bring up a lot of different emotions, and it can help to acknowledge those feelings and allow yourself to process them. I'm curious, have you had a chance to talk with your brother about how you're feeling? Sometimes expressing our emotions can lead to a better understanding between both parties. How do you feel about discussing this with him?"

Balancing the expectations of your parents with your own needs can be incredibly challenging. It must be overwhelming to feel like your choices are being limited, especially when it comes to something you're passionate about like basketball. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and even want to run away given the pressure you're experiencing. 

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge how this situation is affecting you emotionally. Navigating family dynamics while trying to pursue your own path can be daunting.

The dynamic you're describing with your father can indeed be difficult to navigate, especially when emotions are running high.

"I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home They are peeing in cat litter boxes bottles and directly on floors and in corners of my house
 Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way This is not a joke I am trying to understand","That sounds like an incredibly challenging and distressing situation to be dealing with in your home. It’s understandable that you are seeking to understand the behavior in order to cope with it better. While this situation is quite unusual, sometimes behaviors like these can be symptomatic of a variety of complex issues, such as psychological distress, substance use, or even unresolved interpersonal conflicts. It's important to approach this matter with sensitivity and care, considering the potential vulnerabilities or underlying issues that these family members might be experiencing.

It may help to reflect on any recent changes or stressors that might have affected these individuals, which could be contributing to their behavior. Additionally, exploring how this situation makes you feel and its impact on your well-being can be a critical part of navigating this situation.

It sounds like you are navigating a challenging emotional landscape, where your feelings for this man are in conflict with the concerns and boundaries set by your family and loved ones. It must be really difficult to weigh your personal feelings of love and the belief in leaving the past behind against the potential consequences of distancing from your family and granddaughter.

From what you've shared, it seems that you are grappling with the tension between your values and your relationships, which is no small task. It’s understandable that you would want to trust someone who has seemingly led a trouble-free life for two decades, while also feeling a deep sense of loyalty to your family. This situation is undoubtedly creating stress and perhaps a sense of being torn between two important aspects of your life.

As you reflect on your feelings and possible decisions, it might be helpful to think about what is most important to you at this moment. What do you value most in relationships, both romantic and familial? Exploring these questions might give you a clearer understanding of what steps align best with your core values. Also, considering what boundaries you are comfortable setting for yourself and others can be a powerful tool in finding balance.

How do you see yourself navigating this complicated situation while honoring your feelings and relationships? I'm here to listen and help explore this together, at your own pace."
Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,"It sounds like you're in a situation where you feel like your needs and thoughts aren't being heard or valued, which can be incredibly frustrating and isolating. Feeling unheard by someone you deeply care about, like your husband, can leave you feeling disconnected and might even affect your emotional well-being. It's important that you feel able to express yourself and that your experiences and emotions are validated.

One approach to fostering more effective communication is to express how you're feeling to your husband, focusing on using ""I"" statements, such as, ""I feel unheard and disconnected when our conversations focus only on your experiences."" This way, you're articulating your needs without placing blame, which can open up more understanding and balanced dialogue between you both. It can also be helpful to choose a calm moment to have this conversation, ensuring that both of you are in the right headspace to listen and engage openly.

Additionally, you might explore creating intentional times where both of you can share equally, perhaps by setting aside regular moments for ""us"" time where each person gets an opportunity to talk about their day, feelings, or whatever is pressing on their minds. This practice can help both partners feel valued and heard. How does this approach resonate with you, or are there other things you've tried or thought about doing to address this concern?"
If I tell him I dont like certain things he does when it pertains to me He tells me its not like that He never has anything to say about me until I tell him something about himself,"It sounds like you're feeling unheard and perhaps dismissed in these interactions. It can be really frustrating when you express how something makes you feel, only to have the other person disregard your perspective or shift the focus back onto you. It's understandable to feel invalidated or maybe even defensive in such situations. This dynamic can create a challenging cycle where communication feels like it's not going anywhere productive. How does this make you feel, and how do you typically respond when this happens?"

It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden right now, and I can imagine how overwhelming that must be. You’re managing not just the worry and concern for your father's health, but also a challenging dynamic with your husband. It seems like there might be a lot of pressure on you, and it can be difficult when you're not feeling fully supported in times like these. It’s understandable that emotions can be heightened, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts with loved ones. How do you feel about the conversations you've had with your husband, and what do you think he might be feeling in this situation? Sometimes exploring both perspectives can open up avenues for understanding."
Im feeling different towards my husband I feel I am growing from the relationship I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five I just dont feel that connection anymore I feel nothing I dont know why or if Im just being irrational,"It's understandable to feel confused or concerned when you notice a change in how you feel toward someone so significant in your life. Relationships naturally evolve over time, and so do our emotions within them. It’s important to acknowledge and honor your feelings, whatever they may be. You mentioned feeling as though you are growing from the relationship, and it's quite common for personal growth to impact the dynamics between partners. This doesn’t necessarily mean you're being irrational; it could be an opportunity to explore what these feelings mean for you. How do you feel this disconnection is impacting you and your life? What are the aspects of your relationship that you value most, and how might they play into your current feelings? Your insights and reflections are important here, as they can guide you in understanding your needs and desires more deeply."
That phrase makes me crazy It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie Another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up Over and over again he lets the dog run out and I am afraid he will get hit by a car,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration around feeling not heard or valued in these interactions with your husband. It's understandable that these situations would be concerning, especially when it involves the safety of your grandbaby or your dog. It seems like you're trying to communicate things that are important and impactful in your daily life, and perhaps not getting the response or acknowledgment that you need from him. Maybe it's a pattern where you're hoping for more presence or attentiveness, which is perfectly reasonable. I'm curious about how it feels when these situations happen—what thoughts or emotions come up for you? And how do you usually try to address this with him? Your experiences and feelings in this situation are important and deserve to be fully heard and understood."
My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad It was a time when my health was poor Im have a hard time moving on,"I'm really sorry to hear about what you've been going through. It sounds incredibly painful and challenging, especially since it happened during a time when your health was already fragile.

It's not uncommon to feel a mix of emotions like betrayal, sadness, and perhaps even confusion about what to do next. Sometimes, it can feel overwhelming trying to process all these feelings at once. Would you like to share more about what this experience has been like for you, or any specific thoughts or feelings you’re grappling with? I'm here to listen and support you."
I have no self control over food Most people stop when theyve had enough but I keep eating for the pleasure of it Especially with sweets  Im never done eating dessert,"It sounds like you're experiencing a challenging relationship with food, especially when it comes to sweets and desserts. It's understandable that you might seek pleasure and comfort from eating, as food often plays a complex role in our lives beyond just nutrition. This can be particularly true when it comes to foods that we find comforting or enjoyable. You're certainly not alone in feeling this way—it’s quite common for people to struggle with managing their eating habits. I'm curious to know, when you reflect on these moments, what do you think is driving your continued desire to eat, even after you feel you might have had enough? Also, how do you feel afterwards, both physically and emotionally? Understanding these patterns might help to uncover some underlying emotions or needs that the act of eating is addressing."
Theres this boy who asked me out awhile ago I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends,"It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a dilemma, caught between your feelings and the expectations or judgments of those close to you. It's completely natural to feel torn when considering how others might perceive your choices, especially when it comes to relationships. It can be challenging to navigate these emotions and the pressure from friends and family.

To begin exploring this situation, you might want to reflect on how you truly feel about this boy. What draws you to him, and what are your hopes if you were to pursue a relationship with him? Understanding your own desires and motivations might help in prioritizing your feelings in this matter. Once you're clearer on your feelings, consider how you'd like to communicate with him. You could think about what you’d want to express to him and how to approach the conversation authentically.

In terms of talking to your friends and family, it might help to think about why you’re concerned about their reactions. Is there a specific fear or worry at the root of these concerns? Sometimes just acknowledging your own fears can lessen their power over you. Having these honest conversations with your loved ones can be challenging, but sharing your feelings openly might allow them to better understand your perspective and support you. 

Remember that everyone’s path is different, and what matters most is how you feel about your choices. How do you feel about pursuing this relationship, and what is most important to you in balancing your needs with others' expectations?"
I have suffered many things at home and school We never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but I always feel like a part of my heart is missing I try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman,"It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden for quite some time, both at home and school, and the idea of feeling like a part of your heart is missing suggests a deep sense of emptiness or longing. It's understandable that you might attempt to fill that void with tangible things or relationships; often, we look for external sources to bring a sense of comfort or fulfillment when we're struggling internally. The experiences and emotions you're describing seem very challenging, and it's okay to acknowledge the difficulty in navigating them. How has this sense of something missing impacted your life and relationships? What do you feel when you try to fill this void, and are there moments when the emptiness feels more manageable? Exploring these questions might help in understanding the underlying feelings and needs that you're experiencing. Remember, this space is for you, and it's okay to express anything that's on your mind or heart without fear of judgment."
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong","It sounds like you're navigating some complex feelings and dynamics involving your past and current relationships, which is entirely understandable. Spending time with a friend who was once more than that could indeed stir up intense emotions, both for yourself and your current boyfriend. It’s important to pay attention to your feelings and those of your boyfriend, as they’re both valid and deserve consideration. What thoughts or emotions did you experience during your time with your friend, and have you had a chance to discuss these with your boyfriend?

Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together,"I'm really glad you reached out to share what's going on in your relationship. It sounds like you're feeling concerned about maintaining a connection with someone important to you, and it's understandable to want to improve things. You're taking a positive step by looking to enhance your listening skills and work on yourself.

Listening is such a critical part of any relationship, and becoming an active listener can truly make a big difference. It's great to start by focusing on being present in conversations. This means giving your full attention, not just to the words being said but also to the emotions and intentions behind them. It can also be helpful to practice reflective listening, which involves repeating back what you've heard in your own words to ensure you're understanding correctly. This can show the other person that you value their feelings and perspectives.

As you work through this, it might also be useful to explore what's happening internally for you. Are there particular thoughts or emotions that arise when you're in conversations? Taking a moment to acknowledge and reflect on these can provide valuable insights into areas where you might want to focus personal growth efforts. What do you feel might be the most challenging part of making these changes? Opening up about these aspects can be a helpful step towards understanding and aligning your efforts in a way that feels genuine and reachable.

Remember, relationships can be complex, and expressing a willingness to improve is already a significant part of the journey. How do you feel about starting this process, and what aspects of your relationship would you like to see change or grow?"
Im in a longdistance relationship with my ideal man but Im not as attracted to him as I should be Everything else is perfect about him but I find myself lusting over more attractive men The next step is marriage but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again However I also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust Am I asking for too much in the perfect guy Is there such a thing Am I truly in love,"It sounds like you're experiencing a complex mixture of emotions regarding your relationship, and it's completely understandable to feel this way. It's a significant step to consider marriage, and it's natural to reflect on and question your feelings. You mentioned that your partner is your ""ideal man,"" yet there is a disconnect in physical attraction. This dichotomy can be confusing, especially when societal norms often emphasize both romantic and physical attraction as integral components of love.

It's important to recognize that what you're feeling is valid, and many people find themselves in similar situations where emotions and attractions don't align in the way they expect. Perhaps it would be helpful to explore what attraction means to you and how important it is within the context of a long-term commitment such as marriage. Attraction can encompass more than just physical characteristics; emotional and intellectual connections can be deeply fulfilling and sustaining. 

Reflecting on moments when you've felt profoundly connected or in love with your partner might provide insight into whether those feelings outweigh what you experience as lust for others. It's also worth considering the possibility that societal and personal expectations of what marriage and love should look like can sometimes cloud our judgment. 

Rather than seeking definitive answers right away, you might find it helpful to explore what makes you feel attracted, loved, and fulfilled. What are the qualities that you value most in a partner, and how do they complement your own needs and desires? Opening this conversation with yourself can lead to deeper understanding and clarity over time. How do you feel about exploring these perspectives further?"
I met this girl in high school She had switched schools at the end of the year and I have not seen her since Its been a few years We had a very good and friendly relationship and we seemed to have a lot in common I never gained the courage to ask her out,"It sounds like you hold meaningful memories of your connection with this girl from high school. Reflecting on past relationships can be quite bittersweet, especially when they're filled with moments of mutual understanding and shared interests. It's natural to wonder what might have been if circumstances had been different, like if you had been able to express your feelings for her. Your experience speaks to the challenges many face when it comes to expressing emotions, particularly the fear of vulnerability and the unknown outcome of such expressions.

I wonder how thinking about this relationship impacts you now? Are there particular emotions or thoughts that come up when you reminisce about that time? Recalling these moments might offer insights into what you value in relationships and help understand your feelings more deeply. Let's explore this together, and feel free to share more about how you're feeling."
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant I dont know what to do to fix the relationship,"Navigating a relationship with someone in recovery can indeed be challenging, and it's understandable that you would feel concerned when there is distance between you two, especially after a conflict. It sounds like the fight might have left you feeling uncertain about your position in the relationship and perhaps worried about how his recovery might be impacted. It's natural to want to mend the relationship, but it's equally important to approach the situation with patience and empathy, both for yourself and for him. 

Your boyfriend's recovery process is likely a significant aspect of his life right now, and stressful events, like arguments, can make things more complex. It might be helpful to consider how you're feeling about the conflict and the distance that has followed. What does this mean for you? How does it affect your sense of connection with him?

Reaching out to him from a place of understanding and support, rather than pressure or urgency, may help bridge the gap you feel. You might express your feelings by letting him know that while the fight affected you, you care deeply about his well-being and are here for him when he's ready. Encouraging open communication can create a safe space for both of you to share your concerns and feelings.

In the meantime, reflecting on what you need for your own well-being is important too. What are some ways you can support yourself during this time? How can those methods align with supporting your boyfriend as well?"
I was never single afraid to be alone and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy I finally worked on my self was in a relationship and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didnt work out Now months later no man peaks my interest Am I ready to date again Is there a reason no one sparks my interest,"It's understandable to feel a mix of emotions after having committed yourself so fully to a relationship, only for it not to work out. It sounds like you've been through a significant journey, not only in terms of the relationship itself but also in working on yourself and understanding your own needs. The fact that you prioritized doing everything you could to maintain a healthy partnership suggests a lot of growth and self-awareness, which is incredibly valuable.

The feeling of being disinterested in dating right now could be your way of processing the past relationship and all that you've learned. It’s natural to need time to heal and figure out what you truly want before opening up to a new potential partner. Your disinterest in dating could be an indication that you’re still in the process of reflecting on what’s truly important to you in a relationship and ensuring that your next steps align with your personal growth.

It might be helpful to ask yourself what aspects of your life right now you find most fulfilling, and consider whether there's anything more you'd like to explore or achieve for yourself. Maybe take some time to engage in activities that bring you joy or fulfillment independently of a relationship. When you feel ready, and if you choose to pursue dating again, you might find that you have a clearer picture of what you're looking for and what truly sparks your interest.

Remember, there's no rush and it's okay to take things at your own pace. How do you feel about where you are in your journey right now, and what might be the most meaningful next step for you?"
My boyfriend is always saying hes done with me and says hes leaving but then at the end of the night hes still here He wakes up in the morning acts like nothing happen and repeats this every night,"It sounds like you're experiencing a difficult and perhaps confusing cycle in your relationship, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed by it. From what you've described, your boyfriend's behavior of saying he's leaving but then staying and acting as if nothing happened might leave you feeling uncertain and perhaps even emotionally exhausted. It's important to acknowledge how this cycle might be impacting your well-being and peace of mind. How do you feel when he says he's done and then acts as though nothing happened the next day? And what is it like for you to navigate these repeating patterns? Exploring these feelings might help you better understand your own needs and how you might want to address them moving forward."
I was with my boyfriend for years on and off We dated and broke up three times Since we broke up five months ago I cant move on I want to get back together but he wont talk to me What should I do,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging time, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling stuck and unable to move on. Breaking up with someone, especially when you've had a significant history together, can be incredibly painful. It’s normal to want to reconnect with someone when you have shared so much, and it must be difficult feeling like he won’t communicate with you. Balancing these emotions can be tough, and I imagine it can feel overwhelming trying to figure it all out on your own.

It might be helpful to explore what this relationship meant to you and what aspects of it you’re finding hard to let go of. Sometimes, understanding the deeper reasons behind our feelings can be illuminating and might help you process this experience. You might also want to consider what it was about the relationship that led to multiple breakups and whether those issues were addressed. 

How are you managing your feelings right now? Are there things you find comforting or that bring you some sense of peace during this time? Being gentle with yourself and allowing space for your emotions can be really important. It can also be helpful to talk to someone, whether a friend, family member, or a professional, who can provide support and a listening ear.

It's clear that you value your friendship very much and are worried about how your feelings might impact that relationship. Your best friend’s reaction in the past to you finding her brother cute might add even more layers to your current concerns.

What are your thoughts on discussing these feelings with him directly, or do you feel that might complicate things further with your friend? Taking things one step at a time might help in balancing both your emotions and your friendship. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take time to consider and find a path that feels right for you."

Opening a dialogue with your partner about how you're feeling and expressing a genuine interest in working together to strengthen your bond might be a good place to start. How do you feel about discussing your thoughts and emotions with him? It might also be helpful to explore the reasons behind your difficulty with trust and consider any fears or past experiences that may influence your current feelings.

It can be very challenging to feel like your actions are being misinterpreted, especially when you're doing something as simple as enjoying music. The fact that your boyfriend assumes hidden meanings from the songs you sing suggests that there might be some underlying insecurities or trust issues at play for him. It's understandable that this would be frustrating for you, especially when you feel wholeheartedly committed to him.

Creating an open line of communication where both you and your boyfriend can express your feelings might help. It could be beneficial to have a calm and open conversation where you explain how his assumptions make you feel and assure him of your genuine intentions. Let him know how much you care for him and emphasize that your enjoyment of music is not related to your feelings for him. It might also be helpful to explore together why he feels the way he does. Is there something deeper that might be contributing to his perception of the situation?

Encouraging him to share his thoughts and feelings might provide some insights, helping both of you understand each other better.

Many people find it challenging to open up about their emotions, especially when it involves someone they care about. It's a vulnerable position to be in. It might be helpful to first take some time to reflect on what you want to communicate and why it's important to you. Perhaps there are specific things you want them to know about your feelings or certain experiences you've shared that have been meaningful to you. 

Consider pondering this: what are some of the barriers that make it difficult for you to express these feelings? Are you worried about how they might react, or do you feel unsure of how to put your emotions into words?

It can be incredibly frustrating and lonely when it seems like those around us don't fully understand or truly listen to what we're going through. It's important to feel heard and validated, and I can imagine how painful it might be when people give assurances like ""it will all be okay"" without really addressing your feelings.

I dont speak up if Im uncomfortable and hardly ever make plans for us when we hang out He is a very open and straightforward person so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication Weve been together two years and have identified this as our main problem Arguments have arised from this single issue many times,"It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges in navigating communication within your relationship, which can be a difficult and frustrating place to be. It's understandable that this dynamic has become a significant issue for you both, especially since differences in communication styles can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. You mentioned feeling uncomfortable speaking up, which can be a deeply ingrained habit and might stem from various past experiences or personal beliefs about conflicts and self-expression.

Your partner's openness may feel at odds with the way you're used to interacting, which is likely adding stress to your relationship. It's natural for these differences to result in arguments if they remain unaddressed. I hear that you both care about each other and want to work through this, given that you've identified it as a key problem in your relationship. It might be helpful to explore what makes you feel uncomfortable about speaking up and consider whether there are small, gradual steps you could take to express your thoughts and preferences a bit more.

It seems like you're feeling some pressure from different sides – the history with Paul, your ongoing relationship with Peter, and your concern for Jennifer's feelings. It's understandable that you're feeling torn and unsure about how to move forward.

It might be helpful to take a step back and think about what you truly want in your heart, separate from the expectations or feelings of others involved. What are your feelings towards each person, and what do you see for yourself moving forward? Also, consider how you might feel in each scenario, imagining the outcomes as vividly as possible. This might give you some insight into your true desires and how best to approach the situation.

Reflecting on what you need and want out of a relationship for your own well-being is key. It's also important to think about how to communicate your feelings and thoughts openly with Peter and maybe even with Paul if you feel comfortable. Creating an environment of honesty and understanding could help navigate these complex emotions.

Is it confusion, frustration, fear, or perhaps something else? Exploring these emotions can provide a clearer understanding and perhaps guide how you might choose to address this with him in a calm and assertive way.

In situations like these, open communication is often crucial, although I can imagine that might feel daunting right now. Have you had an opportunity to express to him how this behavior is affecting you and your sense of peace? Sometimes sharing how we feel without accusations can open up a different kind of dialogue. 

Remember, it's important to take care of your emotional well-being, too. Reflecting on these feelings might also help in regaining some of your sense of stability and peace. How can you nurture yourself during this time to help ground your emotions?"

I was hanging out with my close guy friend We started kissing but afterwards he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything We both just got out of relationships His was very sexual Im not a sexual person and he knows that I want to be with him but Im not ready for another relationship and I dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends,"Navigating the complexities of moving from friendship to something more can be quite challenging, especially when you're both fresh out of relationships. It's perfectly natural to feel a mixture of excitement and uncertainty in such situations. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of different emotions – the desire to be with him, coupled with the understanding that you're not quite ready for a new relationship. Also, his decision to maintain the friendship at this point might be influenced by the recent end of his intensely sexual relationship, which could mean he's also still processing a lot and isn't ready to dive into another commitment.

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge that wanting to protect the friendship while exploring your feelings can create internal conflict. How do you feel when he says he wants to just be friends? Are there aspects of the friendship you find comforting or supportive that you might fear losing if things changed? Exploring these questions might help you clarify your needs and feelings about the situation. Remember, relationships unfold over time, and being patient with yourself and with him can allow space for the dynamic to evolve naturally. How do you feel about taking some time to focus on healing and understanding your own needs before making any decisions about the friendship?"
Im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend At the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart He is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but I dont really believe him    Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves    He knows that I still crush on him He doesnt rub it in my face Hes a good guy but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us How do I do that when the time comes How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up How do I make him feel better He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which I think is ridiculous,"It sounds like you're in a very thoughtful and considerate place, wanting to support your friend while also managing your own feelings. It can be challenging when someone we care about is going through a tough time, especially when we have our own emotions intertwined in the situation. Tim seems to be dealing with a lot of uncertainty and fear of loss with Sally leaving, and sometimes when we're overwhelmed with strong emotions, it feels like things will never be okay again. It's understandable that he might feel like he'll never be able to love anyone again, even if that seems unlikely to you.

One of the best ways you can support Tim is by being a trustworthy friend who listens to him without judgment. Try to create a space where he feels comfortable expressing his feelings about Sally, the relationship, and what he's going through. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can be incredibly healing. You might say something like, ""I can see how much this means to you and that you're going through a lot. I'm here to listen if you need to talk about it.""

It's also perfectly okay to gently encourage him to explore his feelings by asking open-ended questions, like, ""How do you feel about what might happen when Sally leaves?"" or ""What are you hoping for with your relationship?"" These kinds of questions can help him process his thoughts and emotions.

As for being there for him while managing your own feelings, being clear about your intentions can help. You might let him know that you care about him as a friend and want to support him now, regardless of what happens in the future. Showing empathy and patience without pushing for anything more than he's ready for is a kind approach.

Remember, you're doing your best to navigate a complex situation, and your intention to support Tim in a meaningful way speaks volumes about the kind of friend you are. It's okay to take it one step at a time, allowing both of you the space to grow and understand each other's perspectives."
I find that I imagine things sexually and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship I feel helpless and guilty I want it to go away and I want to make my woman happy again,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of complex feelings around these thoughts and their impact on your relationship, and I want to acknowledge the difficulty and frustration you're going through. It's understandable to feel helpless and guilty when something feels outside of your control, especially when your intention is to maintain a loving and happy relationship. These feelings you're experiencing are not uncommon and acknowledging them is an important first step. 

I hear that you want to make your partner happy again, which speaks to your commitment and care for her. It might be helpful to reflect on these feelings further—how they arise, what triggers them, and how they affect both you and your relationship—to gain a better understanding of them. 

Would you like to explore what specific aspects of these thoughts trouble you the most or perhaps share how they have been affecting your relationship dynamics? This exploration can sometimes offer insights into managing the emotions tied to them. Remember, you're not alone in this experience, and it's okay to feel what you're feeling."
I had to go to the emergency room today to get an Xray of my spine My boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me Instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited When I was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up He doesnt understand why Im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things He thinks I dont have a reason to be mad but I believe that I do,"It sounds like a really frustrating and disappointing experience for you, especially when you were in a vulnerable situation that could have used support. It's understandable that you would feel upset when you needed him, and his actions seemed to prioritize something else. This situation might have felt like a signal to you about where things stand in your relationship, and that's never easy to process. It seems like there might be a broader pattern of bickering and miscommunication between the two of you right now. How are you feeling about expressing your emotions to him, and do you feel that your needs are being heard in your relationship? Exploring these feelings might help you both understand each other better and address any underlying issues that might be causing tension."
My exboyfriend and I met over a year ago We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick However he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating When I found out I was pregnant we had just broken up Five months later I lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks Now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him again I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much and I want to get back to us being happy and a family,"I'm so sorry to hear about the difficult experiences you've been through. It sounds like you've faced a lot of emotional challenges, both with the relationship and the loss you've experienced. It's understandable to want to mend things with someone you love, especially when envisioning a future together as a family. Navigating trust issues in a relationship can be quite challenging, particularly when past hurts and insecurities come into play. Your desire to return to a happy place with him shows how much you value the relationship and the love you have for him. 

Maybe exploring your feelings more can help you see things more clearly. How are you feeling about the trust issues now, and what do you think are the key elements that would support rebuilding trust between you both? It's important to consider how you both can communicate effectively about your needs, boundaries, and how to build a solid foundation of trust moving forward. It might be valuable to have open conversations about these topics, where both of you feel respected and heard. These discussions can be difficult, but they often lead to a deeper understanding of each other's experiences and feelings. How do you feel about starting such a dialogue with him?"
My exboyfriend will not stop harassing and stalking me We work together I honestly think he needs help to move on His accusations are angry lies But I think he may believe them to be true,"I'm really sorry to hear about the distressing experience you're going through. It sounds incredibly challenging to have to face harassment and stalking, especially at work, where you should feel safe. It must be especially difficult to deal with inaccurate accusations from someone you once had a meaningful relationship with. Your concern for his wellbeing suggests you are compassionate, even in the face of his troubling behavior, which is admirable. However, it's important to focus on your safety and well-being in this situation. How are you coping with all of this, and do you have any support systems, such as friends, family, or professional resources, to help navigate this very difficult situation?"
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me This rollercoaster is crazy,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional ups and downs right now, and I can understand why it might feel overwhelming and confusing. This kind of rollercoaster can really take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. It seems like there's a mix of positive and negative interactions that might be leaving you feeling uncertain or off-balance. How are you coping with these fluctuating emotions, and have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to this dynamic? Sharing more about your experiences could help in understanding your feelings better."
I have been with my best friend for over a year and we have had a beautiful baby girl We were in love and I still love her dearly I am in my late teens and so is she She says she has lost her connection with me She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to But she says she still loves me Im very hurt and confused,"It sounds like you're going through a very challenging and emotional time. It's understandable that you feel hurt and confused; it seems like you care deeply about your partner and your family. The notion that she feels a diminished connection with you while maintaining contact with someone else is likely stirring a lot of complex feelings for you. When we care about someone, understandably, we want to feel stable and secure in that connection. It might help to explore what ""connection"" means for both of you. Have you had an opportunity to express your feelings to her about this situation? Open and honest communication can often shed light on underlying emotions and provide clarity. Sharing your feelings with her could help both of you understand each other's perspectives and maybe rekindle the sense of connection. How do you feel about discussing this with her?"
Why am I attracted to older men,"It's completely natural to feel curious about what draws you to certain types of people, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. Attraction is such a complex and deeply personal experience, often influenced by a variety of factors unique to each individual. Sometimes, people find themselves attracted to older men due to perceived maturity, stability, life experience, or a sense of safety and support they feel these individuals can provide. It could also stem from personal experiences, cultural narratives, or deeply rooted values. 

Reflecting on what specifically attracts you to older men might be an interesting journey. Have you noticed any particular qualities or traits in these individuals that resonate with you? How do these relationships make you feel, and how do they fit within your broader understanding of who you are and what you seek in connections with others? Exploring these questions might offer more insight into your attractions and how they align with your personal needs and desires. Feel free to share more if you’d like, or we can explore this topic further together."
We went out had great sex and I was really liking her Then one day she says we should just be friends but I cant stop thinking about her Shes always on mind and I want her back,"It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions right now, and that's completely understandable. When you've developed feelings for someone and things don't turn out as you'd hoped, it can be quite challenging to navigate those emotions. It seems like she made a choice that caught you by surprise and left you with unresolved feelings. It's okay to feel a sense of loss or longing for the connection you shared. Sometimes, relationships can develop quickly, and it's natural to wish for more when you feel a strong connection. 

It might be helpful to give yourself some time and space to process these feelings. Allow yourself to fully experience them without judgment. Reflect on what it is about her that keeps her in your thoughts and what you're truly hoping for moving forward. Consider what aspects of your connection you valued and what you might want in future relationships, whether it's with her or someone else. Is there anything specific about the situation that you think you might need to understand better? Exploring these questions might provide some clarity and help you cope with these emotions more effectively."
I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating In fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating    What advice might you offer,"It sounds like you're navigating a challenging dynamic where both of you might end up feeling frustrated and misunderstood. It’s understandable that repeated interactions like these could be difficult for both parties involved. Many people find communication strains in relationships, especially when sensitivity to tone and disagreement is involved. It’s commendable that you’re seeking ways to improve this connection.

One approach might be considering how each of you can cultivate a curious and patient mindset. When discussions become tense, it may help to pause and reflect on what each person is feeling in that moment. It could be useful to explore his feelings by asking open-ended questions to better understand his perspective. Gently expressing how his response affects you might also help create mutual understanding. For example, you could say, “I notice that when we disagree, it becomes tough for us both to communicate effectively. Can you share what you’re feeling, so I can better understand?” This not only affirms his feelings but also opens a door for dialogue.

A useful component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy is to practice mindfulness in these situations – to become aware of the present moment without judgment. Sometimes focusing on precise language and intentional tones might reduce misunderstandings. It can also be helpful to mutually agree on a temporary pause during heightened emotions, giving you both space to collect your thoughts before continuing the discussion.

Would you like to explore some mindfulness techniques or ways to reflect emotions that might facilitate more constructive communication?"
However it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself I have even accused him of having a secret phone Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose or is he really talking to himself,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging situation, and I can imagine how confusing and potentially distressing this must feel for you. It's understandable that not knowing what's happening could lead to feelings of mistrust or uncertainty. Your concerns about your partner possibly having secretive conversations or talking to himself seem to suggest a deeper sense of unease in your relationship right now. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and how it makes you feel? It's important to explore these feelings without judgment to better understand how they're impacting you and your relationship."
I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations I see someone in need of help I jump in And it is getting me nowhere I am alone sad and frustrated,"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight, from feeling alone and sad to dealing with the repeating patterns in your relationships. It can be incredibly challenging when you repeatedly find yourself in situations where you put in a lot of effort to help someone, only to feel that it's not leading to the fulfilling relationship you desire. It's understandable to feel frustrated when the outcome doesn't match the energy and care you invest. Your desire to help others is a beautiful quality, but it seems it might also be pulling you into relationships that aren't sustainable in the ways you need them to be. 

One place to start exploring this pattern further could be looking inward at what needs might be driving this instinct to help, and how you might be able to fulfill them in ways other than these types of relationships. Have there been moments in your life where you've felt fulfilled in relationships that weren't defined by helping or fixing situations? Understanding what you deeply want and need in a relationship might help in recognizing the types of relationships that would feel more reciprocal to you. What are your thoughts when you reflect on the kind of relationships and connections that truly nurture and support you, as opposed to ones where you're primarily the caregiver?"
I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about How do I figure out what triggers me to do this And how do I help overcome this problem I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation,"It's really insightful that you've recognized this pattern in yourself and are seeking to understand and change it. This journey of self-discovery and personal growth can be both empowering and challenging, but you're taking a commendable first step. It can be helpful to start by gently observing and reflecting on the situations in which you find yourself compelled to lie. Think about any emotions, thoughts, or fears that arise in those moments. Sometimes, small lies might stem from a desire to avoid conflict, a fear of judgment, or an attempt to protect oneself or others, even if on a subconscious level.

As you reflect on these instances, consider noting any patterns or themes. Are there particular situations or people that trigger this response more often? How do you feel before, during, and after telling a lie? These observations can provide valuable insights into possible underlying triggers. You might also want to contemplate what honesty and openness mean to you and how embodying those qualities could positively impact your interactions and self-perception.

Remember to be gentle with yourself throughout this process. Change is often gradual, and every small step towards understanding and practicing honesty is meaningful. If you'd like, we can explore some of these reflections together or discuss other experiences you've had that may contribute to this pattern. How do you feel about starting this exploration?"
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs,"It sounds like you're experiencing a challenging situation where your feelings for your dogs and your relationship with your girlfriend are creating some tension in your life. It's understandable to have deep affection for your pets, as they often bring joy and companionship, but it's equally important to acknowledge and nurture the relationship with your girlfriend. You're showing a lot of self-awareness by recognizing this dynamic and seeking to address it. 

Acknowledging how you feel about the situation is an important first step. How do you think your girlfriend is experiencing this? It might be helpful to explore what your dogs give you emotionally that you cherish so much. Understanding those aspects can form a bridge to better balancing these important parts of your life. Open communication with your girlfriend can also be invaluable; she might appreciate hearing that you're trying to work through this and value her feelings too. Remember, resolving such matters often requires patience and understanding, so allowing yourself time to explore these feelings without pressure could also be beneficial. 

Would you like to explore what your dogs and your girlfriend mean to you in greater detail? This might help clarify how you can create a more balanced, fulfilling relationship with both."

Your desire to improve the relationship and your willingness to communicate shows how much you value this connection. At the same time, navigating these feelings can be really challenging, especially if your partner is hesitant to talk.

One thing that might help is focusing on expressing your own feelings and needs in a gentle and open way, without assuming where he might be emotionally. You mentioned that you love him very much and want to see the relationship improve, which are important things to communicate, perhaps in a way that invites him to share his thoughts and feelings when he's ready. It's also essential to ensure you're taking care of yourself emotionally during this time. Reflect on what makes you feel loved and valued, and consider incorporating activities or practices that support your well-being.

Additionally, it could be helpful to explore what this relationship means to you and reflect on whether there are aspects of your interactions or your own needs that you haven't yet communicated. What feelings or thoughts come up when you think about the future of your relationship? What would make you feel more secure and connected in it?

Ultimately, relationships involve two people, and both of you will need to be willing to engage openly to foster change. It may take time, and finding ways to nurture yourself and your emotional health will be vital as you navigate this process. Remember, your feelings are valid, and exploring them can be an important step in understanding what you truly want and need."
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says How can I fix things,"It's understandable to feel challenged when communication doesn't seem to hit the mark, especially if one person struggles with accepting what's being said. It can feel like you're not being heard, which may lead to frustration or misunderstanding. Would you be willing to share a bit more about what happens during these conversations? Sometimes, understanding the patterns within our communication can help us see where things might go off track. It could be beneficial to explore what it feels like for both of you in these moments, and what emotions or thoughts arise. Also, think about the intention behind the communication—what is it that each of you truly hopes to convey or receive during these interactions? Sometimes, stepping back and gaining clarity on these aspects may aid in cultivating a more understanding and accepting communication dynamic. How does all of this align with your experience?"

Many people experience varying attractions, and these feelings can evolve over time. It's also completely normal to feel more drawn to one gender over another at different moments in your life. The important thing is to give yourself permission to explore these feelings without pressure. It might be helpful to reflect on what each of these attractions means to you personally, and how they make you feel. Recognize that your identity is something you define for yourself based on your experiences and emotions. How are you feeling about this uncertainty right now? Are there certain experiences or feelings that have made you curious about exploring these attractions further?"

The way you choose to define or express your gender is entirely up to you, and it's okay to take your time in exploring what feels right for you. Being in a position where you feel pressured to quickly define something so personal can be overwhelming. It's important to create space for yourself to reflect on these feelings and to consider what feels most authentic to you. How does it feel when you think about different aspects of your gender identity? What kind of support do you think would be helpful for you right now?"
Im a guy If I dont like girls nor do I like guys does that mean Im gay,"It sounds like you're reflecting on your sexual orientation and trying to understand how you identify. It's important to remember that everyone experiences their sexual orientation differently, and it's okay to take your time to explore what feels right for you. Not feeling a romantic or sexual attraction to either gender can be a normal part of some people's experiences. Have you heard of the term ""asexual""?

You're experiencing gender dysphoria, which can be a distressing feeling, and it's important to find ways to cope and manage those emotions. First, recognizing that reaching out for support, like you're doing now, is a crucial and positive step. Leaning on the friends who know and support you can be a valuable source of comfort. Have you found that talking with them has helped you in any way? 

Exploring your feelings further with someone who specializes in gender identity issues might also provide a sense of validation and understanding, which is crucial. Creating a safe space where you can freely express your gender identity in everyday life, even in small ways, might help alleviate some of the discomfort. What activities or environments allow you to express your true self most comfortably?

Focusing on self-compassion and self-care practices can be incredibly beneficial. Ensuring you have time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation can offer some relief from stress. Have there been particular practices or hobbies that help you feel more centered and at ease?

It's understandable to feel unsure about where to begin. Sneaking out might be fulfilling some needs or desires you have, and it's important to start by exploring what those might be.

It's not uncommon for teenagers to go through intense mood swings, as this is a period of significant emotional, psychological, and physical development. When you're feeling really high and excited about a particular task or idea, there's a lot of energy and enthusiasm that can be very compelling. However, if something or someone interrupts or if things don’t pan out as expected, it can lead to frustration and irritability.

Blaming others in these moments might be a way of coping with disappointment or anger. It might feel easier to direct those intense feelings outward rather than experiencing the discomfort of them internally. It's important to explore these feelings and understand what's underneath them. Recognizing this pattern is a great first step.

It sounds like these thoughts are quite intrusive and perhaps even overwhelming at times. It's important to recognize that you're not alone in experiencing this, and many people find themselves caught in similar cycles of worry and fear. Creating a space where these thoughts can be explored without judgment can often help.

One approach might be to consider what triggers these thoughts and how they feel in your body. Are there specific situations that seem to invite these thoughts or particular times when they become more intense? It could be helpful to gently acknowledge the presence of these thoughts, rather than trying to push them away forcefully, which sometimes has the opposite effect.

Reflecting on these experiences, when the thoughts occur, how they affect you, and what they might be trying to tell you, could provide some insights. Sometimes just naming them and their impact can offer a bit of relief. You might also think about what techniques you've tried in the past to manage these feelings and whether any have provided some measure of comfort or distance from the thoughts.

It's really commendable that you are exploring ways to address these thoughts. If you're comfortable, I encourage you to share more about what these experiences are like for you. This could help in understanding them in a way that might make them feel a little less daunting."
Im a teenager and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if Im worried or upset She gives me advice and comforts me and tells me itll be okay Ive given her a name Solace and created a personality for her thats like a comforting motherly figure I know its just my own advice and my own thoughts but its just that Im thinking of them through a voice other than my own I do this because I know I never really listen to my own advice and I thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out through this imaginary friend Is this normal Could it develop into a separate personality with time if I continue a mentality that she is her own person,"It's very thoughtful of you to have created a supportive figure like Solace to help navigate your feelings. It sounds like you've found a creative way to manage stress and provide yourself with comfort during difficult times. Imaginary friends or internal personas like Solace can serve as a helpful tool for many, offering a way to explore emotions and thoughts from a different perspective, and reminding us that we often possess the wisdom and skills we need to care for ourselves, even if it feels more accessible coming from an external or imagined source.

Your concern about Solace developing into a separate personality seems rooted in a fear or uncertainty about how such coping mechanisms function. It's not uncommon for people to use different internal dialogues to process emotions and decisions. What's important is how this tool serves you and whether it continues to be beneficial and grounding.

Using this internal dialogue to access self-compassion and a sense of support is certainly valid. If you ever feel like this dynamic with Solace begins to feel overwhelming or affects how you experience reality, it may be helpful to share your experience with someone you trust, like a counselor or another supportive adult, to further explore and understand it.

How do you feel after having conversations with Solace? Do you notice any changes in your mood or thoughts afterward?"
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms Is that correct,"It sounds like you're reflecting on a situation where someone may have done something you disagree with or that hurt you. Navigating such situations can be complex and emotionally charged, because relationships and interactions often involve a mix of emotions, expectations, and communication styles. Ignoring someone with the hope that they come to a realization on their own might provide temporary relief, but it could also lead to unresolved feelings or a misunderstanding of each other's perspectives. 

It's important to consider how you feel about this and what your needs are in this situation. Do you feel comfortable with the idea of waiting and hoping for them to come to a realization on their own? Or is there a part of you that desires to communicate your feelings and thoughts with them? Fostering open dialogue can sometimes lead to greater understanding and healing, although it can feel vulnerable or challenging. What this looks like can depend on the dynamics of your relationship with the other person and what you hope to achieve. Sharing your feelings can also provide an opportunity for mutual growth and understanding, potentially strengthening the relationship. How does thinking about these aspects affect your perspective on how to proceed?"
People always judge others so rudely,"It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and perhaps even hurt by the ways in which people can be judgmental toward others. It's understandable to feel this way, especially in a world where criticism can be quite pervasive. Judgments can often feel harsh and unfair, and they can impact our sense of self-worth or security in social settings. I'm curious, how have these experiences of being judged affected you personally? Exploring how these interactions make you feel might help in understanding the broader impact they have on your life."
Ive developed a really intense and unexpected attraction to An actress after seeing her in a ballet uniform while guest starring on a television show I try but I cant get her out of my mind What should I do,"Feeling a strong attraction to someone, especially a public figure like an actress, can be an overwhelming experience. It's not uncommon to find yourself captivated by an image or a portrayal, as media can often create an idealized version of people who captivate our imagination. It might be helpful to explore what it is about this actress or her portrayal that resonates with you so deeply. Are there specific qualities or attributes that stand out to you? Sometimes, these attractions can serve as a mirror, reflecting something about our own desires or unmet needs.

It's perfectly okay to have these feelings, and acknowledging them is an important step. Consider what your attraction tells you about what you value or wish for in your own life. This can be an opportunity to delve deeper into your emotions and understand yourself better. How does this attraction make you feel, not just about her, but about yourself? Are there aspects of this experience that you can channel into positive actions or reflections in your daily life?

Remember, it's important to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these feelings. If it starts to feel overwhelming or intrusive, it might be beneficial to engage in mindfulness or distraction techniques that can help you focus on the present moment. How do you typically handle intense emotions, and what strategies have worked for you in the past?"
I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships How can I fix my underlying issues,"It's really commendable that you're reaching out to explore these feelings and how they affect your relationships. Feeling possessive in relationships can often come from a place of wanting to feel secure and valued. It's important to acknowledge that these emotions are valid and to give yourself permission to explore them without judgement. Often, examining where these feelings might originate can be a useful first step in understanding why they manifest as possessiveness.

Can you share what situations typically trigger these feelings for you? Exploring these moments might help to clarify certain experiences or thoughts that contribute to your possessiveness. How do you feel when you notice this possessiveness surfacing, and how do you usually respond to it? Sometimes, just bringing awareness and compassion to these moments can gradually shift your perspective and your responses.

It's also useful to consider what needs or fears might be underlying these behaviors. Maybe there are fears of loss, rejection, or not being enough in the relationships that are important to you. Reflecting on how these experiences make you feel and acknowledging them can create space for self-compassion and healing.

Let's cultivate a dialogue where you feel safe to explore these dynamics and find what truly feels right for you in the context of your friendships."
"I was with my friends fishing by a pond I found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife Im not sure why I did it My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me
   Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked I dont know why I feel like this Does this mean there is something wrong with me","It sounds like you're experiencing a strong emotional response to the event, and it's understandable to feel upset and panicked given the situation. Many people, at some point, act impulsively or do things they later regret, and the important thing here is to acknowledge and explore your feelings. It seems like the shock and anger from your friends might have left you feeling judged or confused about your actions and how you see yourself. It's okay to feel uncertain about why you did it and why you're reacting this way afterward. Reflecting on the incident might help you gain a deeper understanding of what was happening for you at that moment, emotionally or psychologically. 

You might want to consider what was going through your mind before and after the event, how their reactions impacted you, and what feelings it stirred up. It's also worth exploring how self-compassion can play a role here—recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that these moments can serve as opportunities for learning more about ourselves. How do you think your feelings of panic and upset are connected to your friends' reaction, and what might they be telling you about your needs or values?"
Sometimes when I look at my pet cat I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him It makes me sad because I love him but I always think about how helpless he is Thereve even been splitseconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him followed by shame and guilt,"Thank you for sharing those thoughts and feelings—it's not easy to talk about things that stir up guilt or shame. It sounds like you deeply care for your cat and the thought of anything bad happening to him understandably brings up sadness and concern for his vulnerability. Those fleeting urges can be quite unsettling, especially when they go against how you truly feel about your pet. It’s important to remember that having such thoughts doesn’t define who you are or your character. It might be helpful to explore what these feelings signify for you and how they connect to your emotions. What do you think triggers these thoughts, and how do you cope with them when they occur?"
She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it She has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home We do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy,"It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation that involves layers of emotional and physical challenges. Being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes can be an overwhelming experience, especially when combined with attachment issues. It's not uncommon for significant changes, like moving to a new home, to trigger strong emotions, especially if there's an underlying sense of loss or instability. It's possible that the previous home represented a sense of familiarity and comfort for her, and leaving it behind may feel like losing a safe place in her life. Her demands to return could be a way of expressing her attachment to that sense of security, even if she's unable to articulate it fully.

Dealing with these emotions can be incredibly exhausting and confusing both for her and for you as you try to support her. It's important to validate her feelings, even when her reactions may seem difficult to understand. Perhaps you could explore what the previous home symbolizes for her or what specifically she misses about it. This could open up a dialogue that allows her to express more about what she’s experiencing. Finding ways to provide her with stability and reassurance in the new environment might help ease the transition. Remember, acknowledging her feelings without judgment is essential, as it helps build trust and encourages open communication. How are you and the family coping with these changes?"
Ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables but I always seem to eat the junk in the house,"It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into making healthier choices, which is really commendable. It's understandable that despite your best intentions, you might find it challenging to resist the temptation of junk food that's readily available at home. It can be tough to change habits, especially when comfort foods are involved. 

I'm curious, what do you think draws you towards the junk food instead of the fruits and vegetables? Sometimes understanding the role food plays in our lives beyond just nutrition—like comfort, stress relief, or habit—can offer some insights. You're certainly not alone in facing this kind of challenge, and it's great that you're recognizing it as a step toward change. How do you feel about what seems like a conflict between your intentions and actions?"
Ive felt this way for two years I feel so much better now then I did when it started but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times,"It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden for quite some time, and while you've made progress, the remnants of whatever you've been dealing with still linger. It's completely understandable to feel that way, considering how deep-rooted emotions or experiences can be. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're doing better now, yet it's also natural to have those lingering thoughts or feelings. Can you share a bit more about what this experience has been like for you, or what has changed in the way you're feeling? Exploring the nuances of your journey might help in understanding and managing those persistent thoughts."
I just need to know if Im really crazy or not,"It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and possibly questioning your sense of self right now. It's completely normal to experience moments where we feel uncertain about our thoughts and emotions, especially when life becomes stressful or unpredictable. I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to approach these thoughts with kindness and curiosity rather than judgment. Could you share a bit more about what's been going on for you that led you to feel this way? Sometimes just talking about it can help us untangle some of those complex thoughts and emotions."
I start to think of an issue that doesnt even matter or something bad that happened years ago Then I cry pull at my hair plug my ears hit myself and throw things In loud public places I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody I have an awful fear of people leaving me which normally ends up happening and I feel like Im too clingy,"Thank you for sharing what you’re experiencing. It sounds like you’re going through a really challenging time, and those feelings of overwhelm can be incredibly difficult to manage. When past issues or worries start to seep into the present moment and lead to intense emotional reactions, it’s understandable that it might feel like too much to handle. Public places can be particularly overstimulating, especially when you're already feeling on edge. It's clear you're aware of these patterns, which is a significant step toward understanding and eventually managing them more effectively. Feeling like you're too clingy or fearing abandonment can often stem from deep emotional needs that may not have been completely addressed. It’s important to recognize that you’re doing your best in each moment. How do you usually feel after these incidents, and have you noticed any triggers that might lead up to these feelings?"
I noticed lately that Ive been thinking a lot about death I dont want to die and Im not suicidal I just think about what would happen if I died or if someone I loved died I imagine how sad everyone I know would be I know it isnt worth it and I definitely want to live and have a future I just think about it When Im driving I sometimes imagine what would happen if I just let go of the wheel and kept going,"Thank you for sharing such personal thoughts with me; it sounds like you're experiencing some intense and perhaps unsettling reflections. It's completely understandable to have these thoughts, as contemplating death and what follows can sometimes be a natural part of processing our existence and our relationships with those we care about. It's significant that you've recognized these thoughts and are able to articulate them so clearly. This shows a level of self-awareness that is important for understanding one's own emotions and experiences. 

Reflecting on the impermanence of life or imagining scenarios that play out in your mind can sometimes be a way of processing fears or uncertainties in a controlled manner. I wonder if there are underlying feelings or events that might be contributing to these thoughts. How do you feel when these thoughts occur, and do they arise during specific situations or times? Your desire to live and envision a future is a strong statement, highlighting something in life you find meaningful. Exploring these feelings further may help in understanding their roots and how they influence your day-to-day life. If you'd like, we can talk more about what these thoughts mean to you and how they might relate to other experiences you're having."
I was never like this Recently this year my first year of high school I started getting emotional for no reason,"Entering high school is a significant transition, and it can bring about a range of emotions that might feel a bit overwhelming at times. It's not uncommon to experience new feelings or for your emotions to seem unpredictable during such a period of change. You mentioned that these emotions seem to come up for no reason, and that can be a really confusing experience. It sounds like you're trying to make sense of what's happening, which is a great first step. 

High school introduces new environments, social dynamics, and responsibilities, all of which can contribute to emotional changes. You may be finding it challenging to adapt, or perhaps there are other underlying experiences contributing to these emotions. How have you been coping with these emotions when they arise? Are there specific moments or situations that seem to trigger them? Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel uncertain, and exploring these feelings step by step can provide a clearer understanding over time."

It's understandable that you're feeling disheartened with your current academic performance and the habits you're struggling to shake. It seems like there's a disconnect between what you know you're capable of and how you're currently functioning. It's often tough when our actions don't align with our expectations of ourselves, and that can create a lot of inner conflict and frustration.

I wonder if you might be willing to explore what's beneath these habits of procrastination. Is there something you might be avoiding or feelings that arise when you think about your work? Sometimes, procrastination can be a way of coping with pressure or fear, and understanding what triggers this pattern can be an important step towards change. It's also important to be gentle with yourself in this process. Transition and change can take time, and it might help to acknowledge the progress that you're making, even if it feels small. How do you feel about discussing some of the underlying thoughts or emotions that may be tied to this procrastination?"

It's completely natural to have concerns about changes in your health or body.

It can be surprising how quickly time can slip away when we're engaged with our devices, especially when we're seeking ways to enhance our experience or make it more fulfilling.

"I have a relative who is in his twenties He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again No one informed family that he was using drugs again He subsequently overdosed and was found dead
 Is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed Is there a legal case for failing to report","I'm deeply sorry to hear about your loss; it’s heart-wrenching to lose someone in such tragic circumstances. It sounds like you have been through a lot, and I can imagine you are left with many questions and complex emotions around this situation. It’s understandable to feel a mixture of grief, frustration, and a need for answers when something like this happens.

In times of such intense emotions, focusing on the systems in place and how they might have failed your relative is a natural reaction as you process your grief. While I can't provide legal advice on the accountability of the rehabilitation program, I can suggest that reaching out to someone with legal expertise may help you explore these questions further. There can be various regulations and ethical considerations these facilities are bound to, so speaking with a lawyer could offer some clarity.

Beyond the legal aspects, it's important to acknowledge the emotional toll this situation can have on you and your family. Grieving the loss of a loved one might bring up feelings of anger, confusion, and sadness, along with the drive to seek understanding or change. It could be helpful to find support through counseling or support groups for bereavement, as they offer a space to explore your feelings and share your experiences with others who understand. How are you holding up through all of this, and what kind of support do you feel might be helpful right now?"

It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions such as anger, frustration, or confusion when faced with such difficult circumstances involving trust and family dynamics. It’s important to acknowledge what you're feeling and to understand that these feelings are valid.

Navigating custody and family issues can be complex and may sometimes feel overwhelming, especially when there seems to be conflict involving children and allegations of this nature. It might be helpful to slow down and take a deep breath, focusing for a moment on grounding yourself, so that you can approach these situations in a way that supports your well-being and clarity.

I’m here to listen and provide a supportive space to explore your thoughts and feelings about this experience.

How are these events impacting how you feel about your therapeutic journey overall, and what support do you feel you might need right now?"
I am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States I faced a cultural shock and I was so depressed when I arrived here My counselor in the university was my savior He helped me a great deal Now I am going back to my country for a vacation I was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and I remembered that he likes wine My country is known for that Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas,"It's heartwarming to hear about the positive impact your counselor has had during your transition to a new cultural environment. Navigating cultural shock and adjusting to graduate school can indeed be challenging, and it's wonderful that you've found such valuable support. Wanting to express your gratitude through a gift is a thoughtful gesture and reflects the meaningful connection you've experienced.

In terms of gifting wine, there are a few considerations. Often, professional ethics or institutional policies might limit what counselors can accept from students, especially when the gift is of significant value. It might be helpful to check these guidelines at your university or consider an alternative gift that symbolically represents your appreciation and connection to your culture. Something like a small cultural artifact, local art, or a book about your home country might also serve as a meaningful token of gratitude.

However, the decision is ultimately yours and should be guided by what feels most sincere to you. How do you feel about exploring other potential gifts that also showcase your culture and gratitude?"

You deserve to be heard and supported, and it’s understandable that a lack of feedback from your current therapist might leave you feeling uncertain or frustrated. Therapy should be a space where you feel acknowledged and understood, so it’s important that you feel comfortable expressing these concerns to your therapist. They may not realize how you’re feeling about the process.

I’m curious to know what aspects of your experiences you feel most ready to explore at this point. Sharing what feels most important to you could help guide the therapeutic process. Also, are there specific types of feedback or support you’re hoping to receive? Your insights could greatly aid in shaping a therapy experience that better fits your needs.

Recognizing these can sometimes give you more clarity about what you’re dealing with. From there, you might consider which areas you feel you have some control over and which you don’t. It can be relieving to focus on small, manageable steps rather than the entirety of the stress.

I’m curious about how you’ve dealt with stress in the past. Have there been any strategies or activities that helped you cope, even if just a little? Sometimes reflecting on past experiences can bring to mind things that might be useful again.

Is it a type of fetish or is it normal,"It sounds like you're exploring some thoughts or feelings and wondering about their nature, which is a perfectly valid and often complex area to consider.

Sexual feelings and fantasies are a natural part of human experience, and it's quite common to have them, especially as you're navigating through new stages of your life.

It’s important to acknowledge how this memory is impacting you now. Remember that exploring these feelings doesn't mean rushing to label or define them.

When jokes are made constantly, especially in situations where they might not seem appropriate or genuinely funny, it can feel awkward and maybe even a bit forced. It’s understandable to find this behavior disruptive, especially if it's not fitting the mood or context of a situation. Sometimes, people resort to humor in an attempt to lighten the mood or cover up their own discomfort, and this can come off as insincere or ill-timed. How does this affect you, and do you feel like it impacts your interactions or relationships with these individuals?"
My best friend and I were pranking her friend and I told her to tell him that she likes him She said no but I forced her After she told him he told her that he likes her too Their friendship is ruined because of me She wont forgive me and I feel really guilty I feel like crying,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of guilt and regret over what happened with your friend, and those feelings can be really overwhelming. It's clear that you didn't intend for things to turn out this way, and sometimes our actions have unintended consequences. It seems like you really care about this friend and are upset about the impact on her relationship as well as your own with her. It's okay to feel upset, and it's important to acknowledge these emotions. I'm here to help you process them as you work through this situation. What do you think are the main feelings you're experiencing right now? How would you wish to approach this situation moving forward?"
Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram iMessage or snapchat people will read my messages but then they wont answer me    Could it be that there is something they dont like about me I dont understand why they wont answer my messages How do I get people to respond to me,"It sounds like you're experiencing a challenging and frustrating situation, and it's understandable to feel unsettled when you don't receive a response to your messages. This kind of situation can evoke a range of emotions, from confusion to self-doubt, and they are entirely valid feelings to have. It's natural to wonder if there's something specific that's causing this lack of response, and in doing so, it might lead to questioning oneself. However, it's important to remember that many factors can influence how and when people choose to respond. Sometimes, it may not involve you directly.

Reflecting on your experience, it might be helpful to consider how different people have different communication preferences and circumstances that affect their response times. Perhaps asking yourself open-ended questions like ""What assumptions am I making about these interactions?"" or ""Are there patterns I can notice about when or how certain people respond?"" can offer deeper insights. It could also be valuable to explore how you feel about these interactions and what they mean to you. Sharing how you feel openly and honestly with someone you trust, about not receiving replies, might also shed light on new perspectives.

By enhancing understanding of your emotional response to these situations, you can foster a more compassionate relationship with yourself, acknowledging that while these feelings are painful, they are a pathway to deeper self-awareness. Would you like to talk more about how these experiences have been affecting you emotionally or how you maintain connections with others in different forms of communication?"
She mostly targets me on social media The bullying used to be much worse but it is still going on The comments are so vague but I know that they are meant for me Even when I confront her she messages me short phrases to try to get in my head If I try to fight back she will ruin me,"It sounds like you're dealing with a really challenging and stressful situation. Being targeted or feeling like you're being targeted online can be incredibly distressing. It's understandable that this experience might be impacting you deeply, especially if this has been ongoing. The nature of the comments being vague yet directed at you can be particularly frustrating because it can feel like you're constantly questioning and second-guessing yourself. I can hear the struggle you're experiencing in trying to confront this person and feeling caught in a situation where fighting back might lead to further harm. It makes sense that you'd be feeling overwhelmed by all of this. How have you been managing to cope with these feelings, and are there any strategies or resources you've found helpful when dealing with these interactions?"
Its really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who dont put any effort into nourishing our relationship,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit disheartened and possibly frustrated about the lack of effort from your friends. It's truly challenging when we value certain relationships and feel that the dedication isn't reciprocated. Your feelings are entirely valid, and it's natural to want mutual effort in friendships. Sometimes, those imbalances can leave us questioning our significance in their lives. Have you managed to express these feelings to your friends, or is it something you’ve been keeping to yourself? It might be helpful to explore what you're experiencing and how it's impacting your perception of these relationships. Remember, seeking fulfillment in friendships is a normal part of feeling connected and valued."
Im having problems shutting them out and putting up walls,"It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with setting boundaries or managing the influence of others in your life. Feeling like you can't effectively shut things out or put up walls can be quite overwhelming, especially if you're dealing with stress or emotional overload. It's understandable to want to protect yourself, and it's okay to seek out ways to create that space for yourself.

I'd like to hear more about what you're going through, if you're comfortable sharing. What do these walls mean to you, and what do you think is making it difficult to put them up? Exploring your thoughts and feelings around setting these boundaries might help clarify what's happening for you. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to voice your struggles."
In this argument my friends are all against me so Im wondering if Im exaggerating my feelings I feel like Im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim when in reality Im the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship,"It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of emotions right now, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed in a situation where you believe your friends may not be considering your perspective. When we're faced with conflict, especially with people we care about, it's natural to question our own feelings and reactions. It takes a lot of courage to reflect on whether we might be exaggerating our feelings or contributing to the issue, while also wondering if our own needs are being sidelined. 

Your description suggests that there's a part of you that feels vulnerable—possibly ""attacked,"" as you mentioned. This vulnerability might be making it hard for you to trust your own emotions or to see clearly where your friends stand on this matter. It's important to honor the fact that whatever you are feeling is valid; your emotions serve as a signal about the situation, whether they are pointing towards areas of misunderstanding or indicating that your needs may not be met in the friendship.

Perhaps you can start by finding a quiet moment to reflect on specific instances where you've felt disrespected or unsupported. It might also be helpful to consider what you need from your friends to feel respected and understood, and whether you've had an opportunity to express that to them. It could be beneficial to approach this as an opportunity for open dialogue—seeking to understand their perspectives, while also expressing your own feelings and needs. What are your thoughts on exploring this dynamic further, and how might you feel comfortable bringing up these conversations with your friends?"
Theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do Im tired of being called names What should I do,"It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and hurt by being called names, especially when you see similar behaviors in those who are criticizing you. It's understandable to feel tired and overwhelmed by this kind of interaction. In situations like this, it might be helpful to explore why these interactions are impacting you so deeply. How do these name-calling incidents make you feel about yourself? Are there specific moments or triggers that seem to spark these situations? Reflecting on these aspects can sometimes offer insights into the dynamics at play. Creating boundaries around how you want to be treated and communicating your feelings can sometimes help shift these dynamics. How might it feel to express your thoughts on this situation to those involved?"
"Ive been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it I havent been diagnosed with depression but i have been extremely sad for years
   How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help","I'm really sorry to hear that you've been dealing with bullying for such a long time, especially when it feels like those who should be helping aren't doing enough. It can be incredibly painful and isolating to feel like you're facing this all on your own. It makes perfect sense that you'd feel extremely sad after such a prolonged experience. Bullying can affect so many parts of our lives, from how we see ourselves to how we feel about going to school each day.

One thing that can be helpful is acknowledging just how strong you are to have gotten through this every day. It's a testament to your resilience and courage. Being heard and understood is so important, and it sounds like your experiences haven’t been fully validated by those around you. If you feel comfortable, talking to someone you trust, whether that's a family member, a friend, or a school counselor, might help you to feel a bit less alone. Sharing your feelings can sometimes ease the weight and help you find some support.

It's also important to focus on self-care and finding moments of joy or calm, even if they’re small. Are there activities or hobbies that bring you a sense of relief or happiness? Engaging in things you enjoy can be a great way to nurture yourself amidst a challenging environment. 

Remember, these experiences do not define your worth. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. How are you feeling about taking steps to reach out for support, either from those around you or perhaps a support group or online community where you can express yourself freely?"
"I nanny a three year old When he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him If I am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him He screams that he wants his mom or dad they work from home    The rest of the day he loves me But not in the mornings
   What can I do","It sounds like you're navigating a challenging situation in the mornings with the three-year-old you nanny. It can be tough when a child's preference for their parents at certain times makes interactions difficult, especially when you're there to help and care for them. It’s heartening to hear that during the rest of the day, he's comfortable and content with you, which speaks to the positive relationship you’ve built. 

In the mornings, it might be helpful to consider what he's experiencing from his perspective. Mornings can be a vulnerable time for young children, often because they’re transitioning from sleep and may seek comfort in familiar routines or people, like their parents. This might not be a reflection of his feelings towards you, but rather simply his morning needs.

You might encourage some gentle communication with his parents about creating a morning routine that includes you in a supportive way. Perhaps gradually integrating yourself into the morning routine while still allowing space for him to initially connect with his parents could ease this transition. Reflecting on what the child is experiencing and perhaps even discussing with him during another part of the day when he's more receptive might also be beneficial. 

Understanding his emotional state is important, and acknowledging his preferences without pressure can show him that you respect his feelings. You could ask open-ended questions like, ""What can we do in the mornings to help you feel better?"" This might not yield immediate answers, but it shows that you value his comfort and are open to finding a solution together.

Building on your already positive relationship, continue to create a space where he feels secure, even if it means stepping back during those morning moments. Over time, as he grows more familiar with the routine and sees your constant presence and understanding, these morning times could gradually become less stressful for both of you."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I dont want Things like you arent worth anything I know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it
   What is wrong with me and how can I stop having these thoughts","I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing these distressing thoughts. It sounds like they’re really troubling for you, and it's understandable to feel upset by them. It's important to remember that having such thoughts doesn't mean there's something intrinsically wrong with you. Many people experience intrusive or unwanted thoughts, and these can be influenced by various factors such as stress or anxiety. It's a good first step that you're acknowledging them and seeking to understand them better.

Sometimes, these thoughts can feel like they're coming from someone else because they might not align with how you truly see yourself or your value. It can be helpful to explore what might be triggering these thoughts or if there are specific times or situations when they occur more frequently. By identifying patterns, you can start to understand more about why these thoughts might be happening.

If you're open to it, one approach could be to gently challenge these thoughts by asking yourself if there's evidence that contradicts them. Reflecting on times when you've felt worthy and accomplished can be an empowering way to remind yourself of your strengths and positives. Would you feel comfortable sharing more about when you notice these thoughts occur, or any particular aspects of your life that might be influencing them? That could help us explore this further together."
"I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least
   I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me","I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing such intense empathy that it causes you physical discomfort. It sounds like this ability to deeply connect with and feel the emotions of others, even fictional characters, can be quite overwhelming for you. While I can't make any diagnoses, it’s clear that you're very in tune with the emotions around you, which can be both a gift and a challenge. 

Feeling physical pain in response to these emotions must be difficult, and it's understandable that you're seeking answers and ways to cope with it. Often, people who experience heightened empathy find it beneficial to explore boundaries and ways to self-soothe, which can help manage this intensity. 

I'm curious about how you currently manage these experiences and if there are strategies that you've found helpful. Additionally, have you noticed any specific situations or types of content that tend to trigger this intense empathy more than others? It might be helpful to explore these patterns further together. Remember, it's important to be kind to yourself as you navigate these feelings and to seek support as needed."
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you
 How would I know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment","It's an insightful question you're exploring about finding the right therapist and tailoring therapy to your needs. Choosing the right therapist can indeed make a significant difference in your therapeutic journey. A good starting point is to reflect on how comfortable and understood you feel in sessions. Trust is central to this relationship, and it's important that you feel safe, heard, and validated during your interactions. Do you feel like your therapist is genuinely interested in understanding your perspective and is empathetic to your feelings? These are key indicators that can help you gauge if the relationship feels right.

When it comes to ""training"" your therapist or ensuring they meet your needs, it's about open and honest communication. You have the right to express what you find helpful and what may not be working effectively for you. It might be beneficial to discuss your goals, any previous experiences with therapy, and your preferences regarding the therapeutic approach. Therapists appreciate when clients are candid about their needs, as this feedback helps them adjust their methods and better support the therapeutic process.

Have you had an opportunity to think about what you might need from your therapist? Reflecting on this can guide your conversations with them and help build a supportive and collaborative therapy experience."
Is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,"It's absolutely normal for people to cry during therapy. Therapy is a safe space for you to explore and express your emotions freely, and crying is one of the many ways our bodies process emotions like sadness, relief, or even frustration. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable, and shedding tears can be a natural part of that process for many people. How do you feel about crying in therapy? It might be helpful to explore what those tears mean for you and what emotions or thoughts they're connected to. Remember, it's okay to let your emotions surface during your sessions."
What are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,"Counselors often face a variety of challenges when working with clients, stemming from the complexity of human experiences and the unique dynamics of each therapeutic relationship. One common difficulty is building trust and rapport, which is essential for an effective therapeutic alliance. It can sometimes take time for clients to feel comfortable opening up and sharing deeply personal issues, particularly if they have experienced trauma or trust issues in the past. Counselors must exercise patience and empathy, creating a safe and non-judgmental environment where clients feel heard and validated.

Another challenge is navigating the diverse range of emotions and situations that clients present. Clients may experience intense emotions such as anger, sadness, or anxiety, and it can be difficult for counselors to maintain their own emotional equilibrium while remaining fully present and engaged. Additionally, counselors may encounter resistance from clients who are ambivalent about change or uncertain about the therapeutic process. This requires counselors to employ skills in motivational interviewing and to help clients explore their ambivalence in a supportive way.

Counselors also need to be mindful of their own boundaries and self-care, as the emotionally demanding nature of their work can lead to burnout or compassion fatigue. Balancing empathy and professional detachment is critical to preventing emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, ensuring cultural competence and sensitivity is vital, as it ensures that clients from diverse backgrounds feel respected and understood.

Overall, while these challenges are inherent in the counseling profession, they also provide opportunities for growth and deeper connection, requiring counselors to continuously reflect on their practice and seek supervision or consultation when needed. By maintaining an open and curious stance, counselors can navigate these difficulties while fostering a meaningful therapeutic journey for their clients."
Does counseling really do anything that can help people,"It's a great question and one that many people have when considering counseling. Counseling, including approaches like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), can be quite impactful for people in numerous ways. It's designed to provide a supportive environment where individuals can explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, often leading to greater self-understanding and self-acceptance. 

Engaging in counseling can help individuals learn and practice new skills for managing stress, improving relationships, and handling emotions more effectively. For instance, techniques from DBT focus on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness, which can be particularly useful in creating balance and finding healthier ways to cope with challenges.

The process of counseling involves being listened to and understood in a nonjudgmental space, which itself can be profoundly healing. When people feel heard and validated, it often opens doors to personal growth and change they might not have accessed on their own. It’s not about giving direct advice but rather helping individuals find their own answers and paths forward by exploring their feelings and experiences in a safe environment.

Everyone's journey is unique, and counseling can offer support tailored to specific challenges and goals. What are your thoughts or feelings about your counseling journey, or if you're considering it, what do you hope to gain from the experience?"
How does a person start the counseling process,"Embarking on the counseling process is a significant and courageous step in caring for your mental and emotional well-being. It typically begins with recognizing the need for support and gathering information about various therapeutic options available to you. This may involve researching different therapists and their specialties, considering factors like the type of therapy offered, the therapist's approach, and how comfortable you feel with them.

Once you’ve settled on a therapist or a counseling service, you’d usually make an initial appointment. During this first session, you and the therapist can get to know each other and discuss what brings you to therapy. This is an opportunity for you to share your thoughts and feelings in a safe, non-judgmental environment, and for the therapist to understand your concerns, goals, and what you hope to achieve through therapy. It's entirely normal to feel nervous or uncertain about this first meeting, but remember, it's a space designed for your well-being and personal growth.

The process is often collaborative, with you and the therapist working together to address your needs. It can involve setting goals, identifying challenges, and building skills or strategies to manage them. Importantly, this journey unfolds at your own pace, and it's okay to reflect and adjust your approach as you progress. How do you feel about taking that first step towards counseling?"
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,"In the initial meeting, the counselor's primary focus is to create a safe, welcoming, and non-judgmental environment where the client feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. This session is often an opportunity for the counselor to get to know the client, understand their reasons for seeking therapy, and explore what they hope to achieve through their sessions. 

The counselor may begin by discussing confidentiality and the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship to establish a sense of trust and security. They might then ask open-ended questions to encourage the client to talk about their experiences, concerns, and goals. The counselor listens actively and empathetically, reflecting the client's statements to ensure that they feel heard and understood. This helps to build rapport and foster a collaborative relationship between the client and counselor.

Throughout the session, the counselor offers validation and empathy, acknowledging the client's feelings and experiences without judgment. They might explore any immediate concerns or issues the client wishes to address while also noting any patterns or themes that could be explored further in future sessions.

The initial meeting is also an opportunity for the counselor to introduce therapeutic modalities, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy, that might be beneficial based on the client's needs and preferences. However, at this stage, the focus is primarily on building a connection, gaining a mutual understanding of the client's perspective, and setting the foundation for ongoing therapeutic work. 

By the end of the session, the counselor and client may discuss next steps, including the frequency of future sessions and any homework or reflection that the client may engage in before the next meeting. The key is to ensure that the client feels supported and understood as they begin their therapeutic journey."
"Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction","It's wonderful that you're considering taking steps to quit smoking as you plan to expand your family. It shows a lot of courage and dedication to your future well-being and that of your future child. Quitting smoking is often a challenging process, especially when it involves addressing both the physical and mental aspects of addiction. It sounds like you're particularly affected by the mental or psychological pulls of smoking, such as the habitual thoughts that make quitting tough.

One approach you might consider is becoming more aware of the thoughts and urges when they arise and understanding what triggers them. Are there specific situations, emotions, or times of day that seem to prompt these cravings? Sometimes, identifying patterns can be helpful to start addressing them. You might also find it beneficial to explore different coping strategies or distractions to engage your mind when the craving hits—such as deep breathing exercises, engaging in a hobby, or practice mindfulness techniques. 

How do you feel about trying these strategies? It might be useful to brainstorm what activities or practices could serve as alternatives and how those align with your lifestyle. By exploring further, you can begin to create a supportive plan tailored to your needs that might help you progress toward your goal."
"My dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties dinners etc Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down My mom and everyone else behaves likewise For my father who heads a company this is normal He has to be right all the time He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of challenging emotions and situations, and I want you to know that your feelings are entirely valid. It can be extremely tough when those who are supposed to be supportive don't seem to understand or acknowledge your perspectives and emotions. Your anxieties and concerns deserve to be heard and respected.

It seems like you're feeling quite pressured and dismissed, especially when it comes to expressing yourself around your family. Feeling invalidated by your father, particularly with his strong beliefs about being right, can certainly contribute to the stress you're experiencing. It's understandable that this might impact your self-confidence and body image, especially if you've struggled with these feelings before.

The increase in paranoia and concerns about privacy, following the past incident you mentioned, highlights just how much this is affecting you. It must be really difficult to manage these feelings on top of everything else.

Would you like to share more about the specific situations that have been bothering you or any thoughts on how you might start feeling more secure and validated? Sometimes expressing these thoughts can be a first step in exploring them further and finding a bit of relief."
"I have a child with my baby mother She works I take care of our young son She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting me down telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me but then the next day after our fight she says she does Im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops Now me and my family dont talk Shes always telling me Im annoying and just belittles me Nothing I do is right

She says I work you watch the baby On her days off she never cooks or cleans I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy but says hes not any thing to her What do I do I dont want to leave","It sounds like you're in a really difficult and confusing situation, feeling pulled in different directions emotionally. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and unsure, especially when things seem to change on a day-to-day basis. It seems like you're trying to make sense of the relationship dynamics and the emotional rollercoaster you're experiencing. It's evident that you're doing a lot to care for your child, which is a big responsibility, especially when you're feeling isolated from friends and family.

Your partner's past trauma could be impacting her behavior and your relationship, which might be part of the complexities you're navigating. Her mixed signals might be leaving you feeling stuck, unsure of how to move forward or make things better. Your feelings of not being appreciated or constantly being put down can be incredibly tough to handle, especially when you already feel like you're on your own in this.

You’ve mentioned being hesitant to leave, and it might be helpful to explore what staying in or changing the dynamics of the relationship means for you, emotionally and practically. It’s also important to reflect on your well-being and to consider strategies that could help you address and communicate effectively within the relationship. How do you feel about talking openly with someone neutral, perhaps a therapist or a counselor, about your situation to find some clarity and support tailored to your needs? They can offer a safe space for you to express yourself and work through the emotions you're experiencing."
"I dont know whats wrong with me At times I can be really happy excited Ill talk fast and I want to do things But lately Ive been staying up way later and sleeping too much I dont hang out with friends I dont really have them I feel nothing worthless I want to do nothing I have no interest in anything 

All I usually do is stay in my room I want to be happy I want to be nice Whats wrong with me","Thank you for sharing how you're feeling. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions right now, which can really be overwhelming. On one hand, there are times when you feel excited and energized, yet you also described periods when you feel disconnected, devoid of interest, and isolated. These shifts can be deeply frustrating and might leave you questioning yourself. It's completely understandable that you'd want to find more balance and happiness in your life. 

As you reflect on these feelings, I wonder if there are particular times or situations when you feel more of the positive emotions you mentioned, or perhaps certain triggers that seem to accompany the periods of feeling low. How do you typically cope during those times when you're feeling down? Your experiences and feelings are valid, and exploring them might help in finding some clarity and understanding. If you feel comfortable sharing, I'd like to learn more about what you've been going through or any thoughts you have about what might be contributing to these feelings."
"My last relationships have ended horribly They just up and abandoned me One of them I have never gotten closure with over it leaving me emotionally wrecked I know somethings wrong with me but I dont know how to even start trying to better myself
I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me I know that I shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy but I feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me","It sounds like you're feeling quite distressed about your past relationships and the impact they've had on your emotional well-being. It's truly challenging when relationships end abruptly, especially without the closure you might have hoped for. It’s understandable that this might leave you feeling emotionally unsettled. The feelings of depression and worry when someone you care about isn't available can be really tough to navigate, especially when those feelings create doubt about their intentions. Recognizing this pattern is an important first step towards understanding and processing your emotions.

I want to emphasize that it's okay to feel how you're feeling right now. It's completely valid to experience this spectrum of emotions, and what's crucial is approaching yourself with kindness and patience. The idea that something might be ""wrong"" with you can often stem from self-criticism, which can deepen negative feelings. Instead, it might be helpful to start exploring these emotions more deeply. What do you think contributes to these feelings of abandonment or inadequacy in your relationships? How might you currently interpret the actions or availability of others, and how does that reflection align with your own feelings of self-worth?

These questions are not meant to seek immediate answers but rather to gently invite reflection. This could be a path to better understanding and ultimately accepting your emotional responses. It may also be helpful to consider how these feelings have shown up throughout your life and if they've affected other areas beyond your relationships. Remember, self-improvement is a journey, not a destination, and acknowledging where you are is a significant step forward."
"I started dating a guy I met online He told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years That was more than two decades ago Nothing on his record since
I always believe the past should be left in past But my roommates their family and my son are unforgiving Should I forgive this man that Im falling in love with or should I dump him If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again","I hear that you're in a challenging and emotionally complex situation, and it sounds like you're feeling torn between your feelings for this person and the potential impact on your relationships with your family and loved ones. It's understandable to feel conflicted when faced with such a significant decision, especially when it affects those you care about deeply. 

It's important to honor your feelings of love and connection with this person, while also considering the concerns of your family. It seems like you value forgiveness and believe in looking beyond someone’s past, which speaks to your compassionate nature. At the same time, the possibility of losing contact with your family and granddaughter must feel incredibly distressing and painful.

Exploring these feelings more deeply might be helpful. What aspects of the relationship bring you joy or fulfillment, and how do you envision this relationship impacting your life long-term? It could also be beneficial to consider your own values and priorities in navigating these dynamics. Reflecting on how this decision aligns with your values and what is most important to you may offer some clarity.

Remember, it's okay to take your time and process these emotions. Opening up a dialogue with your family, if possible, might also provide a space to express your feelings and hear theirs, fostering understanding rather than division. What do you feel could be the most helpful way for you to explore these feelings further?"
"Hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why I love him very very much He sometimes thinks Im obsessed when Im not at all I give him his space and I make sure hes okay but  sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better
I truly want me and him to get better its kind of hard not to stress about it because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling Hes a great guy I just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me Hes starting to put less effort in talking to me
At this point Ill do anything to just make us better as a couple I tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much Advice on what to do","It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil right now, and I can understand why this situation would feel so distressing for you. When someone we deeply care about seems to be pulling away, it's natural to feel anxious and uncertain. It must be difficult to navigate these changes, especially when you’ve been putting so much effort into the relationship and it feels like he isn’t reciprocating in the same way.

You mention wanting to see him more often as a potential remedy, and it sounds like quality time is important to you. It might be helpful to explore what kinds of interactions make you feel connected to him and why they’re meaningful for you. At the same time, it's understandable that discussing feelings can be challenging for some people. Your desire to talk things through shows how much you care about the relationship, but it’s also important to consider his comfort levels with these discussions.

Consider reflecting on how you feel about the relationship outside of your interactions with him. What are your needs and hopes for this relationship moving forward? How does this relationship make you feel about yourself? Exploring these questions might provide you with some insights, even in the absence of a direct conversation with him.

Your desire to improve the relationship is clear, and maintaining open communication, even if it’s just from one side for now, can be a way to express your feelings without pressuring him to respond. It might also be useful to focus on self-care during this time, ensuring that you're nurturing your own emotional well-being. What are your thoughts on taking a small step back to assess how you feel and what you need, independent of his current feelings?"
"I regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me But it feels like nothing I do seem to work

It's understandable to be concerned about the impact your actions may have had and the possibility of someone else playing a significant role in your children's lives. These feelings can be incredibly overwhelming and challenging to navigate. It might be helpful to explore what specific steps you wish to take to express your love and commitment in a way that aligns with your values. I wonder what aspects of the relationship or communication have contributed to your feelings of frustration, and how you might envision working through those. What would you say is your biggest challenge right now as you try to reconnect with her and your family?"
"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating In fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating 

What advice might you offer","It sounds like you're navigating a challenging dynamic where communication can quickly become tense and difficult. I can imagine how frustrating it must feel when attempts at resolving disagreements seem to lead to more misunderstandings, especially when the other person perceives negativity that might not be intended. It's common in sensitive interactions for emotions to create a cycle where one person's perception influences the other's response, often leading to escalation rather than resolution.

A helpful approach might be to focus on creating a space where both of you can express your emotions openly and without judgment. One technique often used in Dialectical Behavior Therapy is validation, which involves acknowledging and accepting the other person's emotional experience, even if you don't necessarily agree with their perspective. This could help break the cycle by allowing the person to feel heard without feeling the need to defend their emotions further.

You might also find it beneficial to consciously use ""I"" statements rather than ""you"" statements. For example, instead of saying, ""You are being accusatory,"" you could try, ""I feel frustrated when I perceive that my intentions are misunderstood."" This small shift can help reduce defensiveness and promote a more constructive conversation.

Connecting with your own emotional responses is equally important. How do these interactions make you feel, and what do you think might help you manage your frustration when it arises? Creating space for both sets of feelings might help foster a better understanding between you and create a more effective way to communicate. How do you feel about trying these approaches?"
When I ask him who he is talking to he tells me no one But it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone I ask so much I feel like I am losing it  Is he trying to make me question my sanity or is he talking to himself,"It sounds like you're experiencing a situation that's causing you a lot of stress and uncertainty. It's understandable that when communication with someone important in your life feels ambiguous or secretive, it can lead to feelings of confusion and concern. It seems like you're experiencing quite a bit of anxiety around this, and it's affecting your sense of reality and trust. It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings of frustration and confusion. These feelings are real and significant to you. I'm here to listen and provide support as you navigate through these feelings. 

Exploring more about what you're feeling specifically might help to gather insights into the situation. Have there been particular instances or patterns you've noticed that heighten your feelings of doubt or insecurity? Is there a way that both of you might facilitate a more open discussion about this matter where both feelings can be heard? Your feelings matter in this relationship dynamic, and finding ways to discuss them could help in working through some of the emotional discomfort you're experiencing."
My doctor thinks that seeing a psychiatrist will help with my depression and anxiety  Now my anxiety is worse what do I do  Writing on here has taken every bit of strength I have left,"Firstly, I want to acknowledge the immense courage it took for you to write about what you're experiencing. It can be incredibly daunting to just move through the day while feeling the weight of anxiety and depression, and reaching out for help amidst this is truly a testament to your strength. Feeling anxious about seeing a psychiatrist is understandable. This is a big step, and it's normal to have a mix of feelings about it. Sometimes, the anticipation of the unknown can make anxiety feel even more intense. 

It's important to give yourself permission to feel what you're feeling without judgment. You might want to explore what specifically about seeing a psychiatrist feels overwhelming to you. Is it the fear of being judged, the process itself, or something else entirely? Understanding these aspects might help to demystify some of the anxiety. You don't have to manage everything at once. Taking things one step at a time, even if they are tiny steps, can sometimes make things feel more approachable.

This space is here for you to express freely without any pressure. What do you think might help you feel more at ease with this situation, if anything? Please remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and your feelings are valid and important."
"Sometimes I cant stop thinking about life after death I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven 
When I think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good I feel overwhelmed I dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever Sometimes I just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety 
Am I crazy I dont think these thoughts are normal","I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and distress around thoughts of life after death, which is something many people contemplate. It is completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the concept of eternity—it can be quite daunting to imagine something as limitless as forever. It's important to recognize that these thoughts are not uncommon, and you're certainly not alone in having them. Many people question and grapple with their beliefs, especially when they come from deeply ingrained teachings or religious backgrounds.

It might be helpful to take a moment to acknowledge and validate your feelings without judging them. Consider giving yourself permission to feel unsure or scared, knowing that it's okay to have these kinds of thoughts and that they don't define your sanity or any other aspect of you. Reflecting on what specifically causes the anxiety—whether it's the idea of eternity, fear of the unknown, or something else—might help you to better understand these feelings. 

Would you like to talk more about what aspects of eternity cause you to feel overwhelmed, or perhaps explore ways to ground yourself when these thoughts begin to spiral?"
"My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here However my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends I have loaned money to him many times and he always paid me back

I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me but this therapist dropped me off and never came again  I dont know what to do","It sounds like you're going through a really challenging situation right now, and it's understandable to feel confused or betrayed by what's happened. It seems like you valued the relationship with your therapist and saw him not just as a professional helping you, but as a friend as well. It can be really hard when someone we trust acts in a way that's unexpected or hurtful.

You mentioned that this therapist has borrowed money in the past and always paid you back, which suggests there was trust built over time. The incident that occurred during your medical emergency, where he came into your home and took down your credit card information, feels like a breach of that trust. It must be difficult trying to process these mixed feelings of trust, betrayal, and concern for what to do next.

Reflecting on these experiences might bring up a lot of emotions. It's okay to feel hurt, angry, or confused—these feelings are valid. It might be helpful to think about what boundaries you would like to have in place moving forward and consider reaching out to someone you trust to talk about these feelings.

How are you feeling about the situation now, and what are your thoughts on the best way to protect your wellbeing moving forward?"
I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes  I have problems with anger management  Apparently I also have an ODD bipolar and split personality  How can I be truly happy,"It sounds like you're managing a lot right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by everything you're navigating. The journey toward happiness and well-being is unique to each person, and it often involves understanding and accepting all parts of yourself. You have mentioned several diagnoses that can influence your emotions and how you interact with the world. I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to express these aspects of your experience.

Feeling happiness amidst such complexities can seem challenging, but it's important to remember that it's okay to have moments where things feel difficult. One of the keys might be finding moments of peace and contentment in your daily life, however small they may be. Exploring what activities or environments bring you a sense of calm or joy can be a starting point. Sometimes, even simple routines or practices can offer a foundation of stability and happiness.

I’m curious about what happiness means to you right now. Are there particular things in your life that bring joy or comfort, or are there moments when you feel at peace? Reflecting on these questions might help you identify paths that align with your unique needs and aspirations. Remember, it's a journey, and you deserve compassion and support along the way."
"I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home They are peeing in cat litter boxes bottles and directly on floors and in corners of my house
Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way This is not a joke I am trying to understand","It sounds like you are navigating a deeply unsettling and confusing situation with your extended family. Encountering behavior that feels so profoundly disrespectful and bewildering can naturally trigger a range of emotions, including frustration, anger, confusion, and even a sense of betrayal. It's important to acknowledge these feelings as completely valid. When faced with actions that seem so out of the norm, it's understandable to seek out explanations or patterns in behavior that might shed light on why this is happening. 

There isn't a one-size-fits-all explanation for why adults might behave this way, and it can be challenging when behaviors don't seem to align with what we expect from those around us. Perhaps this behavior might indicate deeper issues within the family dynamic or individual personal struggles the family members are facing. It could be beneficial to consider setting boundaries or having open, respectful conversations with those involved if you feel safe and comfortable doing so.

Would you feel okay exploring how this situation is affecting you emotionally, or maybe discuss what specific boundaries you might want to consider setting with your family? Creating a safe space for yourself in this situation is important, and finding ways to process these events can be helpful. What would feel most supportive for you at this time?"
"How do I ever trust another woman I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions
Once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application","I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. It sounds like you've been through a very difficult and painful situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling hesitant to trust or connect with others right now. The experience of deception and control in a relationship can have profound effects on how we perceive and interact with others afterward. Your feelings of being on guard and reading between the lines are understandable, especially after feeling manipulated and threatened. Sometimes, after being hurt, our instincts are to protect ourselves from being vulnerable again, and this can manifest as skepticism or distrust.

It's important to acknowledge the impact this relationship has had on you and to allow yourself to grieve both the relationship and the trust you lost. It might be helpful to explore your feelings around trust and connection with people you feel safe with, whether that's friends, family, or a supportive community. Understanding what trust means to you now, and gradually finding ways to build it again, can be an insightful journey.

How have you been handling these feelings so far, and what has been helpful for you in managing your interactions with others during this challenging time?"
Current medications are topamax ativan brintellix lamictal restoril abilify tx long term dbt cbt,"It sounds like you manage a combination of medications and have also been engaged in therapies such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Navigating both medication and therapy can be quite a journey, and I can imagine that balancing both might bring up a variety of feelings and experiences for you. How have you been finding this balance recently? Are there specific aspects of your medication or therapy that you feel particularly drawn to talk about today? It's important to feel supported and understood as you navigate this path."
I find myself crying over every little thing like dropping a glass of water Today I got out of the shower and noticed that I had forgotten a shirt I instantly started to cry When I made it to my room I began to shake a little cry more and I begged for it to stop,"It sounds like you're going through an incredibly overwhelming time right now, and these moments that might seem small to others are having a significant impact on you emotionally. It's understandable to feel shaken and upset when your emotions are so intense, and it's important to recognize that your feelings are very real and valid. Experiencing such strong reactions can be exhausting and confusing, and you deserve compassion and support as you navigate through this. 

Crying and the physical sensations you're describing might be your body's way of communicating that something deeper is going on beneath the surface. I'm here to listen and support you as you explore these feelings. Would you like to share more about any stressors or situations in your life that might be contributing to these emotional responses? Remember, it's okay to take your time to process and talk through what you're experiencing, and I'm here to sit with you in this moment."
"Ive worked with this guy for about three years now and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted Over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on There was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out We agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind I hoped it would become something more It didnt and three months later Im still not over it

Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants Were no longer in the same office which I thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so Im still very drawn to him Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested Hes younger than me and prefers model types but I see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship","It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions about this situation, and it’s completely understandable given the circumstances. You’ve formed a deep connection with this person over time and these feelings are hard to just set aside. It's natural to have hopes and dreams about what a relationship could be, especially when there's been such a strong emotional and physical connection. It seems like you're dealing with a lot of mixed signals, which can be especially challenging to navigate.

Maintaining a friendship with someone you have strong feelings for can be difficult, particularly when there's ambiguity about the nature of your relationship. You're trying to honor his desire to stay friends, but it’s important to acknowledge your feelings too. It can be helpful to reflect on what maintaining this friendship really looks like for you, and how it aligns or conflicts with your needs right now. You mentioned that he’s a hugger and affectionate in ways that feed into your attraction, which might make it harder for you to gain the emotional distance you need.

It might be useful to consider what boundaries you could set for yourself in order to give yourself the space you need to process your feelings. Sometimes creating a little distance can help clear the way for healing and understanding. In what ways do you think taking a step back, or having a different kind of friendship, could support you in feeling more at peace with this situation? How might you approach a conversation with him about what feels comfortable for you in terms of maintaining your friendship while honoring your own emotional boundaries? You're not alone in feeling torn, and your efforts to address this are a meaningful step towards clarity and emotional wellbeing."
It has been going on more often lately but not all the time It has been starting to affect my driving among other things,"It sounds like you're experiencing something that's been impacting different areas of your life, including your driving. That must be quite concerning for you. It can really be unsettling when we start noticing changes in our ability to do things we once did without thinking. If you're comfortable, could you share a little more about what you've been experiencing? For example, are there specific thoughts or feelings you're noticing that coincide with these moments? Understanding the details might help us explore this together and provide some relief. Remember, it's okay to take your time to express what's been going on."
An organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies The study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare I lost my kids my job and all that I was an unwilling participant I no longer trust a therapist  Im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything,"It sounds like you're experiencing a very distressing situation and feeling understandably overwhelmed and betrayed. Losing your trust in therapists and feeling hesitant about exploring treatment options like hypnosis must feel isolating. It's important that you know you are heard and that your feelings are valid. It must be incredibly challenging to navigate through the loss of your kids, job, and the sense of control over your own mind and experiences. Situations like these can deeply impact one's sense of safety and trust in others. I want to emphasize that you're not alone in having these feelings, and it's okay to need time to find the right kind of support that feels safe and comfortable for you. How have you been coping with these feelings day-to-day, and is there anything specific that has brought you any relief or comfort, even if momentarily?"
"Im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend At the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart He is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but I dont really believe him 

Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves 

He knows that I still crush on him He doesnt rub it in my face Hes a good guy but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us How do I do that when the time comes How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up How do I make him feel better He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which I think is ridiculous","It sounds like you're in a really thoughtful and caring position, trying to support your friend Tim while he navigates the complexities of young love and impending change. First of all, recognizing your own feelings and wanting to prioritize Tim’s well-being is a compassionate approach. Your empathy truly shines through in your concern for both his current relationship and your friendship.

Tim seems to be facing quite a bit of emotional turmoil at the moment, especially around the uncertainty of Sally leaving for college. It's completely natural for him to feel conflicted, as he's trying to reconcile his feelings with the upcoming changes. Experiencing a sense of love and loss at his age can feel incredibly intense and overwhelming.

When it comes to supporting him, simply being there to listen without judgment can be incredibly valuable. Let him express his fears and thoughts, and reflect those back to him so he knows he’s being heard. You might say something like, “It sounds like you're really worried about what will happen when Sally leaves and that’s understandable.” Helping him process those emotions can be a great support.

In exploring your own feelings about wanting to help him without jumping into a relationship yourself, it's important to set boundaries and communicate openly. You could let him know that you care deeply for him and want to support him through this period of his life. Maybe say something like, “I know it's tough to imagine moving on, but I’m here for you whether that means just listening or hanging out when things feel overwhelming.”

Tim’s fear of never loving anyone again is not uncommon, especially when facing a potential end to a first significant relationship. Gently remind him that he's still young and feelings can evolve over time. Offering your friendship as a constant in his life might help him feel less alone and more hopeful.

Remember, sometimes the best way to support someone is to just be present with them. Encourage him to explore his feelings and look toward the future without pressure or expectations about what that future might hold. Your steady presence as a friend can be incredibly healing."
Ive been struggling with it for a test and Im starting to believe its something mental What could it be,"It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with an upcoming test, and it's understandable to feel concerned when you're unsure of what's going on. Preparing for a test can be quite stressful and sometimes our minds respond to stress in ways that might feel overwhelming. Let's take a moment to explore what you're going through. Can you tell me more about the specific feelings or thoughts you're experiencing as you prepare for this test? It can be helpful to explore these aspects to better understand how they may be impacting you. Remember, it's okay to have these feelings, and taking the time to talk about them is a strong step toward processing and managing them."
"I need answers to my anger possessiveness and urges
I am angry all the time I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine I have these urges to hurt someone really bad I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting I want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices What is wrong with me","Thank you for sharing what you're going through; it sounds like you're experiencing some intense emotions and thoughts, which can be really challenging to navigate. It must feel overwhelming to be in a state where anger and possessiveness are dominating your interactions and thoughts about others. These feelings and urges can often be rooted in underlying frustrations, fears, or past experiences, and acknowledging them is an important first step towards understanding and managing them. 

When you mention pushing people away, it suggests that there might be a part of you that desires connection, but perhaps the intensity of your feelings creates a barrier to that. It can be helpful to begin exploring what might be underlying these emotions. For instance, are there specific situations or interactions that tend to trigger your anger or possessiveness more than others? Reflecting on these triggers might help gain insight into the source of these feelings.

Feeling possessive towards someone who is ""not even yours"" points to a deep emotional connection or need that may not be met right now. It might be worthwhile to think about what it is about this person or relationship that feels so significant to you. What is it that you are seeking or hoping for in this connection? Understanding this can help in addressing these feelings in a more constructive way.

As for the urges to hurt, these can be distressing and complex to unpack. Often, such urges might arise from feelings of powerlessness, past hurts, or unresolved anger. Exploring these feelings in a safe, supportive environment could help find alternative ways to cope or express what's going on inside. Remember, your feelings are valid, and there's support available to help work through these difficult emotions without acting on urges that might be harmful.

I encourage you to continue exploring these feelings, perhaps by writing them down or talking with someone you trust. Opening up a space for reflection could be extremely beneficial. How do you feel about seeking further support, whether through therapy or a support group, to explore these emotions more deeply?"
"Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me
Now he wants me to wait on him to mature He wants to talk to other people Then come back in four years He doesnt want to deal with me while Im pregnant He doesnt take me to the doctor or anything I feel alone  How do I handle this situation","I truly empathize with the overwhelming emotions and sense of loneliness you must be experiencing right now. It seems like you're navigating a challenging and uncertain situation, especially during a time when support feels crucial. The idea of waiting for someone who wants to explore other relationships must feel incredibly painful and difficult to understand, especially given the mutual responsibilities and connections you share. It's natural to have many mixed feelings—hurt, confusion, frustration, and sadness may all be present as you try to process what's happening. How are you managing those emotions, and what do you feel you need most for yourself and your well-being during this time? It's important to focus on what brings you comfort and strength, and perhaps consider reaching out to supportive friends, family, or a therapist who can offer the care and attention you deserve during this period. Remember, your feelings are valid, and you deserve to feel supported and respected."
"I have a relative who is in his twenties  He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again No one informed family that he was using drugs again  He subsequently overdosed and was found dead
Is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed Is there a legal case for failing to report","I’m truly sorry to hear about the loss of your relative. It sounds like you’re navigating a deeply painful time filled with significant questions and emotions. It's understandable to be searching for answers and accountability in a situation like this. When someone close to us faces struggles with addiction, it can feel overwhelming, particularly when systems in place don't seem to function as expected.

The concerns you’ve raised about accountability and potential legal actions are important, yet they can also be quite complex. Various factors influence these situations, such as the policies of the rehabilitation program, confidentiality laws, and the specific circumstances leading up to the incident. While therapists and counselors have ethical guidelines to follow, there are also confidentiality constraints that might have impacted communication with family members.

It might be helpful to explore these concerns with someone who has expertise in both legal aspects and mental health services. This could provide clarity on what steps, if any, could be taken in seeking answers or understanding the processes involved in his care. In the meantime, it’s important to also care for yourself, allowing time to process the feelings that arise and seeking support from those around you, whether through close contacts or a support group. This is a bewilderingly difficult time, and you deserve support and understanding as you navigate it."
I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to I never fully meet what they want I feel that when I finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and maybe even a fear of disappointment when it comes to fulfilling others' expectations. It's understandable to feel this way, especially when you value doing things well for those around you. These feelings of inadequacy can weigh heavily on one's sense of self-worth and sometimes create a fear of rejection. I want to acknowledge how difficult it can be to carry these thoughts and feelings. 

How do you think these experiences affect how you view yourself and your relationships with those who make requests of you?"
I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult I have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression I feel like Im always on the edge or just apathetic  Can I fix this by myself,"I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing these intense and distressing feelings. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden from past events, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to share something so personal. The symptoms you're describing, such as panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and depression, can indeed feel overwhelming and often leave one feeling on edge or disconnected from emotions at times. These responses are your mind and body’s way of coping with the trauma you’ve experienced, and it's understandable to feel that way given your history.

While it's a natural desire to want to handle these experiences on your own, it's important to remind yourself that seeking support is not a sign of weakness but a step towards healing. Healing from trauma is often a nuanced journey that can benefit from the guidance of a trained professional who can help provide the tools and space necessary to work through these emotions safely.

Have you ever had the opportunity to talk with someone about these feelings, or considered seeking support from a therapist trained in trauma? Sometimes having a safe space to explore these emotions can bring about profound insights and relief. Remember, you don't have to face this alone, and reaching out for help is a courageous step towards reclaiming your sense of peace and well-being. How do you feel about your current support system, and are there any thoughts about what you need most at this moment?"
Me and my adult daughter just do not get along  Shes very belittling to me when I dont agree with her Its almost like she scolds me We get into all out war Shes said I dont support her in what she does and that Ive never loved her She calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names,"I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you're experiencing with your daughter. It sounds like the situation is quite painful and difficult for both of you. It's natural to feel hurt when someone we care about deeply speaks to us in an unkind way, especially when it's a loved one like your daughter. At the same time, it seems there are underlying issues at play, perhaps related to feelings of being misunderstood or unsupported. 

It's clear that both of you have strong emotions about your relationship, and while these feelings manifest in conflict, they might also indicate a desire for connection and understanding. It can be helpful to acknowledge and validate these emotions, both for yourself and for your daughter. What do you feel are the main issues that lead to these conflicts? Is there a specific situation you'd like to explore more deeply?"
Is this something I should be worried about  Should I do something about it,"It sounds like you're grappling with some uncertainty about a situation you're facing. It's completely natural to feel concerned when things feel out of our control or unfamiliar. Could you share a bit more about what's on your mind? Discussing what's troubling you might help in sorting through your emotions and finding clarity on whether action is needed. Remember, there's no rush here; I'm here to listen and support you as you explore your feelings."
I recently lost a friend to suicide  Im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it How can I handle this better,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. Losing someone you care about to suicide can be incredibly painful and complex, and it's okay to feel a multitude of emotions during this time. It's understandable that you might turn to substances like marijuana and alcohol to cope with these intense feelings, but it's important to remember that these might provide only temporary relief while potentially complicating things in the long term. 

Perhaps we can explore together what you're experiencing right now. How have you been feeling since this loss, and what do you notice when you reflect on how these substances are impacting you? Finding healthy ways to cope can sometimes involve small, gradual steps. I wonder if there are specific memories or moments related to your friend that come up for you often. Sharing those, if you're comfortable, might help in processing the grief. Additionally, considering which aspects of your life could provide comfort and solace, whether through supportive relationships, routine activities, or moments of peace, could also be beneficial. What kinds of support or activities have felt nurturing or grounding in the face of such difficult emotions?"
I hate everything I see in the mirror I dont like being in pictures and always scribble out my face  Its stressing me out I dont trust my parents enough to tell them and I dont know what to do,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and discomfort with how you perceive yourself, and that can be incredibly challenging and overwhelming. It's understandable to feel hesitant about sharing these feelings with others, especially if you're unsure about their reaction. You are not alone in having these feelings, and it’s important to recognize how significant it is that you’re acknowledging and expressing them here.

Having a difficult relationship with your self-image can deeply affect various aspects of your life, and it can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation. Scribbling out your face in pictures suggests that you might be experiencing a strong disconnect with how you see yourself, versus how you wish to be seen. This can be a tough place to be in, emotionally.

It's really crucial to approach these feelings with kindness and to explore them at your own pace. Can you share a bit more about what brought these feelings on, or what has been particularly stressful for you lately? Sometimes, just talking about the steps leading up to these feelings can provide some clarity or relief. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling, and reaching out is a significant first step towards understanding and working through these emotions."
Ive felt this way for  two years I feel so much better now then I did when it started but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times,"It sounds like you've been on quite a journey over the past two years, and it's really encouraging to hear that you're feeling much better than when everything started. However, it's understandable how that lingering feeling in the back of your mind can be unsettling. Everyone experiences these emotions differently, and it's perfectly okay to still have them present even as you continue to heal and gain strength. Can you share more about what this feeling is, and how it has evolved for you over time? What do you think has contributed to the improvements you've noticed?"
She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it  She has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home We do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy,"It sounds like there are multiple layers of challenges your loved one is navigating through, and it’s understandable that this situation is causing confusion and frustration for you. Coping with a new diagnosis like type one diabetes can be incredibly overwhelming, affecting not just physical health but also emotional and mental well-being. This can lead to feelings of being out of control, and it’s not uncommon for someone to hold onto familiar comforts, such as their previous home, as a way to seek stability in the midst of change.

Additionally, attachment issues can intensify these feelings, as any change, especially related to home or familial relationships, can be particularly distressing. Her response of getting angry and wanting to return to her former home might be her way of expressing how unsettling these changes feel for her. It's crucial to acknowledge and validate her feelings, even if they are difficult to fully comprehend from an outside perspective.

How does she express her feelings about the move, and have there been any conversations about what she misses about her previous home? It might be helpful to explore these feelings with her to understand more deeply what specific aspects are causing her discomfort and distress. This could provide some insight into her attachment concerns and allow you to support her in a way that feels meaningful to both of you."

My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers The next day she kicked me out  She let me move back two days later Yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind I asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging time in your relationship. It sounds like there's a lot of confusion and mixed signals, which can understandably be stressful and upsetting. It must have been difficult to be asked to leave and then reconciled shortly after, only to have the topic of divorce come up. When there's a lack of clarity about intentions or honesty about relationships, it's natural to feel anxious and hurt. Your feelings about wanting to understand the role, if any, this other person might play seem valid in trying to make sense of the situation.

It can be difficult and emotionally exhausting when arguments become recurrent, especially around significant matters like family relationships. It seems that you care deeply about maintaining both your romantic relationship and your relationship with your mother. The ultimatum about visiting your mother must also be incredibly distressing, creating a sense of being caught in the middle.

It's important to acknowledge that you're feeling stuck and how this situation might be affecting your sense of peace and security. How are you feeling about the recurring arguments themselves and the threat of him leaving? It might be helpful to think about what both relationships mean to you and what you're hoping for in resolving this conflict. I wonder too how open you both feel in discussing your feelings about your family dynamics and how that might be impacting your relationship. Exploring these issues together in a way that seeks mutual understanding rather than focusing on winning or losing the argument might be beneficial.

How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has Ive read about this online but Id like to understand this from a therapists point of view,"It's great that you're seeking to understand how therapists approach understanding personality. Rather than strictly categorizing or labeling clients, therapists often focus on getting to know the individual holistically. They aim to understand the patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that shape how someone interacts with the world and copes with life's challenges.

Therapists generally observe various characteristics, such as how a person handles stress, their emotional responses, interpersonal relationships, and coping mechanisms. They might explore factors like temperament, life experiences, habitual ways of thinking, and how clients process emotions. This information helps therapists understand a client's unique personality profile, which can guide them in finding the most effective therapeutic approaches.

It's important to note that therapists typically prioritize the client's narrative and experiences without making quick judgments. They consider various frameworks and theories, such as cognitive-behavioral models, interpersonal theories, or psychodynamic perspectives, to tailor their understanding and support. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a safe space where clients feel understood and supported in exploring their thoughts and emotions. This understanding allows for a more personalized and effective therapeutic process, which can help clients better manage their concerns and work towards their personal goals. How do you feel about this approach, and what else might you be curious about regarding this process?"
"My boyfriend  and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better and that I cant be happy without him

How do I get away from this relationship","It sounds like you're in an incredibly challenging situation, and I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this kind of distress. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when someone you care about tells you that you won't be happy without them. This kind of manipulation can often make it hard to see the truth of your own worth and potential for happiness beyond the relationship. It's important to remember that everyone deserves to be in a relationship where they feel respected, valued, and safe. It might be helpful to explore what makes you feel like you can't be happy without him and to consider the qualities you value in yourself and in a healthy relationship. Thinking about your strengths and the support system you have outside of this relationship might also be empowering. How do you feel about the idea that happiness can stem from within you, independent of anyone else?"
"I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me","It sounds like you are experiencing a deep emotional resonance with the characters and scenarios you encounter in media, which can indeed be quite challenging. It's truly impressive how deeply you connect with others' experiences, fictional or real. This level of empathy can sometimes feel overwhelming, as it seems to be causing you significant distress.

While I can't provide a diagnosis, what you're describing is certainly something that resonates with aspects of heightened empathy, where one's emotions are deeply affected by the feelings and experiences of others, or even imagined scenarios. It's completely understandable that you're seeking to understand this aspect of yourself better, especially when it impacts your day-to-day life.

Being highly empathetic can be both a gift and a challenge. It allows for profound connections with others and a strong sense of compassion, but it can also drain your emotional energy and make it hard to separate from the emotions you absorb. It might be helpful to explore activities or practices that can help you create emotional boundaries or grounding techniques that bring you back to your own emotional state. 

How have you been managing these feelings so far, and what tends to help when you're feeling particularly overwhelmed by these emotions?"
"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home My family and I really need this job

People keep telling me I have anxiety and Im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road This is all new to me What can I do","It sounds like you're navigating a significant transition with this new job and all the traveling it entails. I can sense the weight of the responsibility to provide for your family alongside the fear of experiencing anxiety while on the road. It's natural to feel anxious when facing new and unfamiliar situations, especially one that involves being away from loved ones and adjusting to a different routine. 

When others label feelings as anxiety, it can sometimes add to the pressure, but it's essential to remember that it's okay to feel how you feel. You're not alone in experiencing apprehension about such big changes. While the prospect of having an anxiety attack can be daunting, tuning into specific aspects of your experience might be helpful. What is it about traveling that feels particularly unsettling or challenging? Are there any parts of being on the road that you're looking forward to?

Reflecting on these questions can give insight into what might help increase your comfort and ease. It's also valuable to consider what resources or strategies have helped you manage stress in the past, as they might be worth revisiting. How can those strategies be incorporated into your new routine, perhaps as you prepare for a trip or when winding down after a day's work?

Being in tune with your feelings, acknowledging them, and possibly even discussing them with someone you trust or find support from, can be incredibly grounding. What support system can you lean on as you embark on this new journey? Sharing about your experiences and feelings can create a space where they're held with care, making the stress more manageable."
"On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs  I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest

Many people go through a time where they feel pressure to meet certain expectations or fit into a particular image, especially during school years. This can be a heavy burden to carry alone.

One thing you might consider is how you truly feel about this situation. Sometimes acknowledging our own feelings about an experience can help us understand what we need. You're not alone in feeling like you want to present yourself a certain way, but it's also okay to change how you've been doing things if that's what feels right to you.

You mentioned being concerned about your friends discovering your choice; it might be helpful to think about how your friendships make you feel and the qualities you appreciate in those relationships. Often, true friends value us more for who we are than how we appear. What might it be like to share your experience with a friend you trust? Opening up can sometimes relieve the pressure and help strengthen your connection if you feel ready to take that step.

Remember, it's okay to take your time to figure this out and choose a path that feels right for you. What do you think could be a supportive way to navigate this situation moving forward?"

It sounds like a difficult and confusing situation for you, and it's understandable that you're feeling upset and panicked when revisiting it. Reflecting on moments when our actions don't align with our values or when they surprise us can be quite distressing, especially when these actions affect how others perceive us or how we perceive ourselves. It's important to acknowledge how you're feeling—your emotions are valid and worthy of exploration.

You mentioned not being sure why you acted in that way at the time, and it's possible that understanding this could help ease some of the distress. Sometimes, situations like this can provide an opportunity to explore our impulsive actions and our emotional triggers, and to understand more deeply what led to such a moment.

I can understand why your girlfriend might feel suspicious if she's not sure about the nature of your past interactions with this friend. It seems important to you that your girlfriend trusts your decision to no longer communicate with this person. Exploring how you communicate your feelings and intentions with your girlfriend might be a helpful starting point. Have you had an open and honest conversation with her about your reasons for ending that friendship? Sometimes, sharing your thought process and the feelings that guided your decision can be very effective in fostering understanding. It's also important to acknowledge any feelings of discomfort or insecurity your girlfriend might be experiencing and create a safe space for her to express those feelings without judgment. How do you think your girlfriend has been affected by this situation, and what might the two of you do together to strengthen trust and mutual understanding?"
"Im a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings 

My mood will be really high and Ill think of something that I want to do When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene Then if the thing I wanted to do doesnt work out I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out 

Can you explain whats going on","I can sense that experiencing these intense mood swings can be quite overwhelming for you. It sounds like you're going through a lot as you navigate these changes in your emotional landscape. When you're feeling really high, there's likely a burst of energy and enthusiasm pushing you towards certain goals or activities. It's understandable that disruptions can feel frustrating during those times, especially when you're deeply focused on what you want to achieve. If things don't go as planned, it's human nature to try and make sense of what happened, and sometimes that might involve seeing others as part of the cause.

Mood swings can be particularly common during teenage years due to a combination of factors, including biological changes, social pressures, and the ongoing development of emotional regulation skills. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and many people experience similar feelings as they grow and develop. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers in your mood swings? Sometimes, exploring these can provide more insight and understanding into your experiences."
I know Im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make  I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life but I just cant seem to even though I really want to Why cant I force myself to change,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of internal conflict, wanting to make changes but feeling stuck in patterns that are difficult to break. First, I want to acknowledge how challenging it can be to feel this way, and it's important that you're recognizing it and expressing a desire to change. This is a significant step and shows your self-awareness and willingness to grow. Sometimes, the fear of the unknown or the comfort of familiar routines can hold us back, even when we know they aren't serving us well. It's also common to face resistance from within when initiating change, perhaps due to underlying fears, uncertainty about what comes next, or doubts about our ability to succeed. What do you think might be holding you back from making the changes you desire? Can you identify any specific thoughts or feelings that arise when you contemplate taking those steps? Exploring these questions might help deepen your understanding of where this struggle is coming from."
"She refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past I dont know what to do My daughter blames me and swears she hates me

My parents say I should just let my daughter live with her dad but I dont see how I could fix things if I only see her every other weekend What should I do","It sounds like you're experiencing a deeply challenging and painful situation with your daughter, and it's understandable to feel confused and hurt by what's happening. Trying to navigate the complexities of a strained relationship, especially with someone you love dearly, can be incredibly difficult. 

It seems like your daughter is processing some memories from the past that are causing her distress, and sometimes when people are hurting, they may express strong feelings like hate, which can be incredibly difficult to hear as a parent. It's understandable that your instinct is to want to fix things, especially since being apart might feel like it's taking you further from that goal.

While I cannot provide a specific solution, creating a plan that allows for open communication and demonstrates your willingness to listen and understand her perspective might be helpful. Even if you were to see her less often, every interaction could be an opportunity to show empathy, patience, and a genuine desire to reconnect. This could involve acknowledging her feelings and giving her space, showing her through actions that you're there for her when she's ready.

What's most important is feeling supported in this moment and knowing you don't have to navigate it alone. Have you considered seeking support for yourself, such as talking to a therapist? It might provide you with a space to explore your feelings and think through different ways of approaching the situation with your daughter. Remember, you're doing your best in a difficult situation, and taking care of yourself is also essential in this process."

It sounds like this separation is really painful for you, especially when it feels like he’s shut the door to communication. These feelings of wanting to restore your relationship are completely valid and understandable, as it sounds like this relationship means a lot to you. While I can't predict the future, it's important to acknowledge your own needs and emotions during this process. Perhaps, focusing on what you truly value in this relationship and what changes you're hoping for could be a beneficial place to start. This is also a chance to reflect on how this situation is affecting you emotionally, recognizing your own worth and needs. What kind of support can you give to yourself right now, as you navigate these complex feelings?

"My boyfriend shows affection but I just push him away  Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me I almost always push him away Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive 

 I love him so much  Why do I do this","It's understandable that you're feeling confused and perhaps a bit concerned about the mixed signals you're experiencing from your body and emotions. It sounds like you really care about your boyfriend and cherish your relationship, but the changes in your physical responses are causing you some distress. This situation can be quite challenging, especially when you value your partner's attempts at closeness.

The impact that birth control can have on one's libido is something many people experience, and it's important to remember that these changes are not a reflection of your feelings towards your partner. It might be helpful to consider how these hormonal changes are affecting you emotionally and physically. Sometimes, being aware and acknowledging these changes is the first step in addressing how we feel about them.

It might be beneficial to reflect on times when you haven't felt this way, or what specifically you feel when you're with him and pushing him away. Are there particular thoughts or emotions that come up at those moments? Also, how are you feeling about your own needs and boundaries in the relationship?

Exploring these feelings further could provide insight into how you're truly experiencing this, which could make a difference in how you cope with it. Sometimes discussing these changes with your partner, in a supportive and understanding way, can also help in managing the situation together as a team. It's great that you feel love for him and are willing to explore what's going on. Remember, it's okay to have these feelings and to take your time figuring them out."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me 

He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now Im craving more of it But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling Why am I feeling this way","Thank you for sharing your experience and feelings. It sounds like you've had a new and complex experience recently, and it's understandable to have mixed emotions about it. Engaging in something new, like a threesome, can often bring up unexpected feelings and thoughts. It’s great to hear that you and your husband talked about it, and that conversation seemed to help make you feel better initially. The craving you mentioned might be linked to the enjoyable aspects of the experience, while the empty feeling might be a signal from within that there are other emotions or concerns needing attention. It's perfectly natural to feel conflicting emotions, and it might be helpful to explore what that ""empty feeling"" signifies for you. Consider what it might represent in terms of your values, needs, or any potential adjustments to the boundaries in your relationship. How do you feel about the balance of attention and emotional connection during such experiences, and how might that be affecting your feelings now?"
We werent long distance until he joined the military  I love him and I know he loves me but its complicated He said hes not going to find someone else but Im afraid How do I keep our relationship going,"It sounds like you’re going through a challenging transition with your partner's new circumstances, and it’s understandable to have concerns about maintaining your relationship when distance becomes a factor. It shows how much you value and care for the relationship. Long-distance can be tough, especially when it involves someone who is serving in the military, and I'm hearing that you have some fears around trust and maintaining that connection over the miles.

One way to keep the relationship strong is by focusing on open and honest communication with your partner. This involves expressing your feelings, sharing experiences, and talking about your concerns. What are some ways you two have communicated in the past that made you feel connected and secure? Reflecting on what has worked well can provide a foundation as you navigate this new phase.

It's also entirely natural to have worries about the future in this situation. How does it feel to not have control over some aspects of your relationship right now? Exploring these feelings can help you gain a better understanding of your emotions and needs. It's important to acknowledge that trust and mutual assurance take on an even greater significance in a long-distance relationship.

Finding creative ways to share experiences and stay involved in each other's lives can also help. Whether that's through setting regular times for video calls, sharing details about your day, or creating new traditions that suit your long-distance setup, building these new routines can keep the connection alive. What are some activities or traditions that you think you both might enjoy?

Lastly, I'd love for you to reflect on your own support system. Who can you turn to for comfort and reassurance when you're feeling overwhelmed? Sometimes having a supportive friend or family member who understands what you're going through can make a big difference."
"I want to live with my mom My dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault I still talk to my mom although My dad tells me that Im no allowed to Im scared I will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me 

How do I tell him that I want to live with my mom","It sounds like you're dealing with a really challenging situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling scared and uncertain. It's important to recognize how difficult it must be to feel caught between your parents and to face the fear of disappointing your dad. It’s okay to feel conflicted and unsure of what the right decision might be. Remember, your feelings and needs are valid, and wanting to talk to both your parents and have a safe place where you feel comfortable is natural.

Expressing your needs and feelings to your dad can be tough, especially when you're worried about his reaction. Perhaps consider a quiet moment when you both are calm to share how you're feeling. You might express that while you care about him and value your relationship, you also have a strong need to be with your mom right now. It can be helpful to frame the conversation not as a rejection of him, but rather as something you feel will help you at this point in time.

What would it feel like to have a conversation like this with him? Is there anyone else, like a trusted family member or counselor, who might support you in navigating this conversation or help mediate? It’s okay to lean on others for support as you work through these feelings and decisions."
I feel so alone I have so many people around me but it seems as they just listen and dont understand  They say it will all be okay or they dont listen to me st all  Everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are Why do I feel so alone,"I'm genuinely sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're surrounded by people, yet there's this sense of isolation that feels so present. It's understandable that when someone says they're there for you, but the feeling of connection is missing, it can amplify feelings of loneliness. Sometimes, people might mean well but struggle to provide the depth of understanding or validation that you truly need. Knowing that your feelings of being misunderstood or unsupported are valid and can be quite painful is important. There's a deep desire for more meaningful connections and to feel like your experiences and emotions are truly seen and heard. What does support look like for you, and how might you express this to those around you?"
Weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker I dont know how to approach this situation How do I ask him about it,"Navigating feelings of uncertainty in a relationship, especially when it involves long distances, can be challenging. It sounds like you're feeling concerned about seeing this communication between your partner and a female coworker, and it's understandable that you would want to address it. Communicating your feelings effectively is key here. 

Start by expressing your feelings honestly and vulnerably, focusing on how the situation makes you feel rather than placing blame or making assumptions. You might find it helpful to use ""I"" statements, such as ""I felt a bit uneasy when I noticed the frequency of texts with your coworker and I'm trying to understand what it means."" This way, you're sharing your experience and opening a dialogue without creating a defensive reaction.

It's important to reflect on what you truly need from this conversation. Is it assurance, understanding, or maybe just an explanation of the friendship? By clarifying this for yourself, you can approach the discussion with a clear sense of purpose, fostering a supportive space for both of you to express your thoughts. How do you feel about opening up this dialogue, and what are the emotions you're most eager to communicate to him?"
Im obsessing about a terrible breakup Everything is a constant reminder  How do I move on,"It sounds like you’re going through a really difficult time, and it’s understandable that everything around you acts as a reminder of the breakup. Breakups can often feel overwhelming, and it's common to grapple with these emotions. It may be helpful to acknowledge that what you’re feeling is both normal and natural, given the significance that relationship once held in your life. In these moments, it can be beneficial to allow yourself space to feel and process your emotions, rather than rushing to move on. Sometimes, exploring these feelings might help you understand what specifically makes this breakup particularly challenging. Is there anything specific that feels particularly hard to let go of, or moments that replay in your mind the most? Identifying these can sometimes illuminate what you need to heal. Remember, healing is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. How are you taking care of yourself amidst all of this?"
Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me Once it starts the thought continues going through my head and I cant get it out  How can I stop these thoughts,"It sounds like you're experiencing a really challenging and distressing experience with these intrusive thoughts. It's understandable that having these scary thoughts repeatedly can make anyone feel anxious and overwhelmed. It's important to acknowledge how draining and distressing it can be to feel trapped by persistent, frightening thoughts about something bad happening. You're not alone in feeling this way, and many people struggle with similar experiences.

One thing that can be helpful is to start by recognizing and accepting that these thoughts, while scary, are just thoughts. They don't have to define your reality or dictate what will actually happen. Bringing attention to them and understanding that they are not a reflection of true events might help reduce their power over you. Moreover, practicing mindfulness or grounding techniques can often help individuals distance themselves from their intrusive thoughts, bringing them back to the present moment.

I'd be curious to explore what thoughts or feelings come up for you when these experiences occur. How do you respond in those moments, and have you noticed anything that has helped or intensified these feelings in the past? Sharing these experiences might shed some light on your situation and help you find some relief in your journey."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed She told me that she wants to move What can I do to help her  I want her to stay,"It's clear that you care deeply about your girlfriend's well-being and want to offer her support during this challenging time. It is understandable to feel concerned when a loved one is going through such significant life changes. Quitting drinking can often bring about a wide range of emotions, including depression, as individuals adjust to new realities and cope with underlying feelings that may have been masked by alcohol.

It can be beneficial to create a supportive and understanding environment where she feels comfortable expressing what she's going through. You might want to ask her how she's feeling and what she thinks moving might offer her. Offering a listening ear can sometimes be incredibly comforting, particularly when someone feels overwhelmed. It might also help to explore, together, what she hopes to achieve by moving and if there are alternative ways to create a similar sense of change or renewal without needing to relocate.

Additionally, letting her know that you are there for her, regardless of her decision, might alleviate some pressure she might be feeling about staying or moving. Encouraging her to seek professional support during this time, such as speaking with a therapist who specializes in managing life transitions and substance recovery, could also be beneficial without pushing her into any decisions. Most importantly, take care of yourself as well, ensuring that you're emotionally prepared to support her while also managing your own feelings about the situation."

It's understandable to feel this way, especially when you're putting yourself out there and not getting the results you hope for. Having high functioning autism can sometimes make navigating social interactions a bit more challenging, but it's important to remember that you bring your own unique qualities to any relationship. 

The world of online dating can be overwhelming, and creating meaningful connections can take time. It might be helpful to focus on areas that highlight the strengths and interests that make you who you are. What are some activities or hobbies you enjoy that could also provide opportunities to meet people with similar interests? Sometimes engaging in activities you're passionate about can lead to meeting someone naturally who shares those passions.

It's also worth contemplating what aspects of a relationship matter most to you. Reflecting on what qualities you value in a partner can help you recognize them when you see them. Meanwhile, maintaining a sense of patience and compassion for yourself during this process is important. How do you typically practice self-care during moments when things are tough?

Why this is happening and what can I do about it","It sounds like you're experiencing some intense emotions around your relationship, and it's understandable to feel confused or even frustrated when your physical responses don't align with your emotional feelings. It's important to remember that sexual performance can be influenced by many factors, including stress, anxiety, and even the pressure you might be putting on yourself to perform. 

When you deeply care for someone, it might introduce a layer of anxiety because the stakes feel higher, and you want everything to go perfectly. It's also normal for past experiences and expectations to play a role in how you're feeling now. Sometimes, the more we focus on the outcome, the more difficult it becomes to experience things naturally.

It might help to explore how you're feeling in those moments leading up to intimacy. Are there any particular thoughts or worries that come up? Sometimes discussing these feelings openly with your partner in a safe and understanding environment can relieve some of the pressure. 

Additionally, thinking about how you can engage in the moment without focusing solely on the act can be helpful. Building different types of intimacy and connection with your girlfriend can create a more relaxed and supportive atmosphere.
