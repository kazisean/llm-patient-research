I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor They wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog I have the paper work and I gave it to my apartment manager They said I cant keep the ESD because Im not disabled What do you suggest I do,"I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're experiencing. It's important to know your rights when it comes to having an emotional support animal (ESA). Here are a few steps you can take:

. **Understand ESA Laws**: Emotional support animals are protected under the Fair Housing Act (FHA) in the United States. This law requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, which includes allowing ESAs even in no-pet housing policies.

. **Document Your Need**: Ensure that your documentation includes all necessary information, such as the specific ways in which the ESA helps with your condition. A letter from a licensed mental health professional detailing your need for an ESA as part of your treatment plan can strengthen your case.

. **Communicate with Management**: Provide a copy of the Fair Housing Act to your apartment management and explain your rights. Sometimes a misunderstanding about the law can be cleared up with a polite, informative discussion.

. **File a Complaint**: If your apartment management still refuses to accommodate your ESA, you have the option to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or consult with a tenant rights or disability rights lawyer to explore your options.

. **Seek Support**: Consider reaching out to local tenant advocacy groups or organizations that specialize in disability rights. They may be able to provide guidance or support in navigating the situation.

Remember, it’s essential that your ESA request is accompanied by proper documentation substantiating your need for the animal. Stay calm and assertive in your communications, and consider seeking legal advice if necessary."

Sometimes, people are drawn to sadness because it can feel familiar or it provides a deeper emotional experience. Engaging with sad music or tragic stories can be a way to process emotions, feel a sense of catharsis, or even a way to connect with the deeper aspects of life.

However, if focusing on negative aspects of your life is becoming overwhelming or if it’s impacting your well-being, it might be helpful to explore this with a professional, like a therapist. They can help you understand these feelings better and find a healthier emotional balance.

Remember, it’s okay to experience sadness, but it’s also important to find joy and positivity where you can. Finding activities or practices that elevate your mood could offer a different perspective and enrich your emotional landscape."

I am a teenage girl Ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young The problem is that I dont remember anything about this dream I still know that its the same one and then I wake up in a panic and I cry really loud without knowing the reason Why do I see the same dream why can I not remember it and what should I do to remember it,"Recurring dreams are quite common, especially during adolescence, as this is a time of significant mental, emotional, and physical development. There are several possible reasons for experiencing recurring dreams and difficulty remembering them:

. **Emotional Processing:** Dreams often reflect emotions and experiences that we are processing subconsciously. Recurring dreams may indicate unresolved feelings or situations in your waking life.

. **Stress or Anxiety:** If you experience stress or anxiety, it might manifest in your dreams. This could explain both the recurrence and the feelings of panic upon waking.

. **Suppressed Memories or Emotions:** Sometimes, dreams can relate to memories or emotions that your mind is not ready to fully confront or remember, leading to difficulty recalling them.

To better understand and possibly remember the dream, you might consider the following steps:

- **Dream Journal:** Keep a notebook by your bed to jot down any details you recall as soon as you wake up. Over time, this can help you piece together elements of the dream.

- **Relaxation Techniques:** Engage in relaxation or mindfulness techniques before bed. This can include deep breathing, meditation, or gentle stretching to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.

- **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns or triggers in your waking life that might correlate with the recurrence of these dreams.

- **Consult a Professional:** If the dreams are significantly impacting your well-being, it might be helpful to speak with a therapist who can assist you in exploring potential underlying issues.

- **Focus on Positive Imagery:** Before falling asleep, try to focus on positive images or imagine a good outcome to the dream. This can sometimes help in rewriting the narrative of your recurring dream.

Understanding your dreams can be a journey, and it might take some time before you fully grasp their significance or contents, so be patient with yourself during this process."

I am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism We try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen so we just talk in a calm voice However other kids see the treatment as unfair,"Working with children who have autism can present unique challenges, but with some thoughtful strategies, you can create a positive environment for everyone involved. Here are a few suggestions to help you in this situation:

. **Inclusive Activities:** Encourage activities that all children can participate in together. This can help reduce feelings of unfairness and promote inclusivity. Ensure there are options available that cater to varying interests and abilities.

. **Structured Routines:** Children on the autism spectrum often benefit from routines and structure. Having a predictable schedule can help them feel more secure and reduce anxiety, leading to fewer behavioral challenges.

. **Peer Buddies:** Pair the child with autism with a peer buddy who can assist and support them during activities. This can help both children develop social skills and promote understanding among peers.

. **Focus on Strengths:** Make sure to highlight and capitalize on the unique strengths and interests of all children, including the child with autism. This not only boosts their confidence but also allows other children to see them in a positive light.

. **Open Communication:** Keep an open line of communication with the other camp counselors, the administration, and possibly the parents to share insights and strategies for managing behavior effectively.

. **Professional Support:** If available, seek advice from specialists or therapists who have experience working with children on the autism spectrum. They can offer valuable insights and strategies for managing behavior and fostering inclusion.

Implementing these strategies can help create a more inclusive and supportive camp environment for the child with autism and ensure that all children feel they are being treated fairly."

My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training He almost throws up every time he sees his poop He gags and will not go on the toilet We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it When he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress,"Toilet training can be challenging, especially when a child experiences fear or anxiety around using the toilet. Here are some strategies that might help:

. **Go Slow**: Understand that this is a significant transition for your toddler and give him time. Avoid putting too much pressure on him to use the toilet for pooping right away.

. **Create a Routine**: Establish a regular and predictable routine for toilet visits, especially after meals. This can help your child associate pooping with being on the toilet.

. **Positive Reinforcement**: Use praise, stickers, or small rewards to celebrate any progress, even if it’s small. Rewards could be for sitting on the toilet or attempting to poop, rather than the outcome itself.

. **Model and Teach**: Read books about potty training or show videos that portray toilet use positively and as a normal part of growing up. This can help reduce anxiety and make it more relatable and less scary.

. **Comfort and Relaxation**: Ensure that the toilet environment is comfortable. If he seems tense, help him relax with deep breathing or gentle back rubbing. You can also sing a soothing song or play calming music.

. **Desensitization**: Gradually expose him to the toilet and the act of flushing. Let him flush the toilet so he can see it’s nothing to be afraid of. Allow him to be in the bathroom during your toilet visits to normalize the process.

. **Address the Gag Reflex**: If his gag reflex is in response to seeing his poop, try to limit exposure initially. After he poops in his diaper, clean it while he’s out of sight, and gradually introduce him to the idea of poop going in the toilet.

. **Dietary Adjustments**: Ensure he has a balanced diet with enough fiber and fluids to make pooping easier and reduce any discomfort associated with it.

. **Consult a Pediatrician**: If these strategies don’t alleviate the issue, or if your child seems excessively stressed, consult a pediatrician. They might offer insights or recommend a specialist or therapist specializing in children’s toilet training.

. **Patient Conversations**: Talk with him about any fears and reassure him gently. Sometimes understanding the ""why"" behind a fear can help a child overcome it. 

Remember, each child is different, and what works for one might not work for another. Patience and reassurance are key during this transition."

. **Talk to Someone:** Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about how you're feeling. Talking about it can often help you gain perspective and support.

. **Focus on Health, Not Numbers:** Try to focus on how you feel rather than the number on the scale. Think about maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle that includes nutritious meals and physical activity that you enjoy.

. **Avoid Comparisons:** Social media and other platforms can make us unfairly compare ourselves to others. Remember that everyone is different, and what you see online isn't always the full picture.

. **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. Recognize that everyone has struggles and imperfections.

. **Educate Yourself:** Sometimes understanding more about nutrition and what your body needs can help relieve some of the pressure. Consider talking to a healthcare professional or nutritionist for information and advice tailored to you.

I always need alcohol to feel better and use that as a excuse,"It sounds like you might be using alcohol as a way to cope with difficult emotions or situations.

My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while She goes out gets trashed and then expects everyone to take care of her The next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated She also thinks everyone hates her all the time If I dont seem anything other than happy she asks me Do you hate me You hate me Tell me you love me and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging situation with your roommate. It sounds like your roommate is struggling with significant issues that might require professional help. Here are some suggestions on how to address the situation:

. **Encourage Professional Help:** Gently suggest to your roommate that speaking with a mental health professional could be beneficial. Therapists and counselors can provide support and coping strategies for both substance use and mental health concerns.

. **Set Boundaries:** While it’s important to be compassionate, you also need to take care of yourself. Set clear boundaries about what behaviors you can and cannot accept. Let her know that while you care about her, you can't always be responsible for her well-being, especially when she's drinking.

. **Communicate Openly:** When she's sober and calm, have an honest conversation about how her behavior affects you and your household. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings without sounding accusatory (e.g., ""I feel overwhelmed when I have to take care of you after you've been drinking"").

. **Be Supportive, Not Enabling:** Support her efforts to seek help but avoid enabling behaviors that allow her to continue her drinking problem without facing consequences.

. **Look After Yourself:** Make sure you are also taking care of your mental health. This might mean seeking guidance from a therapist yourself or finding support groups where you can share experiences with others in similar situations.

. **Emergency Situations:** If she becomes suicidal or poses a danger to herself, it's important to contact emergency services or a crisis hotline for immediate help.

Remember, while you can offer support and encouragement, it's not your responsibility to ""fix"" her problems. Take care of yourself and make sure you're also leaning on others for support when needed."
I always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people I know that no matter what I do or how I change there will always be some people who hate me Why do I feel this way,"Feeling the need to impress others and being concerned about their opinions is quite common and can stem from various psychological and social factors. Here are a few possible reasons why you might feel this way:

. **Desire for Approval:** Humans are social creatures, and feeling accepted by others can be deeply rewarding. Seeking approval can reinforce your self-esteem and make you feel valued.

. **Self-Esteem Issues:** If you struggle with self-esteem, you might seek external validation to feel good about yourself. Impressing others can temporarily boost your self-worth.

. **Social Media Influence:** In today's digital age, social media can amplify the pressure to present a perfect image. This constant exposure can make it seem essential to gain approval from peers.

. **Upbringing and Environment:** Sometimes, family expectations or the environment you grew up in can place a high value on external achievements and impressions, leading you to internalize these pressures.

. **Fear of Rejection:** Fear of being rejected or disliked can drive the need to be liked by everyone. This fear can make you focus on making a good impression.

. **Perfectionism:** Striving for perfection can cause you to feel the need to prove your worth constantly. This can lead to anxiety about others' perceptions of you.

To address these feelings, it might be helpful to:

- Reflect on your own values and what genuinely matters to you.
- Work on building self-compassion and recognizing your intrinsic worth, independent of others' opinions.
- Limit the influence of social media if it exacerbates your stress.
- Practice setting boundaries and prioritizing genuine connections over surface-level approval.
- Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor for personalized guidance and support in understanding and managing these feelings."

Acknowledging and addressing these feelings is an important step in moving forward and rebuilding your relationship. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

. **Understand Forgiveness**: It sounds like your boyfriend has chosen to forgive you because he values your relationship and believes in your commitment to each other. Forgiveness can be an act of love and a decision to work towards a better future together. Understanding his perspective might help you come to terms with his decision.

. **Self-Reflection**: Take some time to reflect on why those situations occurred and what you have learned from them. Identifying any patterns or underlying issues can help you grow and prevent similar situations in the future.

I like getting attention from men I dont have sex I lead them on to thinking I might want to I like to tease I like for men to chase me and I like to feel wanted,"It sounds like you're exploring your feelings and interactions with others. It's completely normal to enjoy attention and to appreciate feeling desired, as long as everyone involved is being treated with respect and honesty. However, it's important to consider the feelings of the people you're interacting with to ensure that everyone is on the same page and no one is being misled or hurt. Communication and honesty are key in any type of relationship, whether it's romantic, platonic, or something else. It might be helpful to reflect on what you're looking for in these interactions and how you can express that openly to ensure a positive experience for everyone involved."

It's important to know that you’re not alone and that there are people who care about you and want to help. The feelings you're experiencing can be incredibly overwhelming, and it’s crucial to address them in a supportive environment.

Firstly, comparing yourself to others can be incredibly damaging, and it's common to feel this way during the teenage years because of the many changes and pressures that come with this stage of life. However, what you're describing—feeling the need to throw up to avoid gaining weight, feeling like you do everything wrong, and feeling alone in your struggles—can be indicators of deeper issues that may require support.

These feelings and behaviors aren't something you should have to go through alone, and they may not go away on their own. I strongly encourage you to talk to someone you trust about how you’re feeling, whether it's a parent, guardian, teacher, school counselor, or mental health professional. They can provide support, understanding, and guidance.

Professional help, such as talking to a therapist or counselor, can be particularly beneficial. They can work with you to help manage these feelings and build a healthier self-image and coping strategies.

Remember, seeking help is a strong and positive step toward feeling better. You deserve support and kindness, both from others and yourself."

I recently went through a divorce My exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me My sister never defended me Now that I showed the truth shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight Why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. Family dynamics can be incredibly complex, and it's challenging when a situation like this arises. There could be several reasons why your sister didn't defend you or conveyed her feelings differently to both of you. It's possible she was trying to avoid conflict, felt caught in the middle, or didn't know how to handle the situation. She might have also assumed maintaining neutrality was the best approach at the time. 

It's important to express how you feel to your sister and explain why her reaction was hurtful. Honest communication can help both of you understand each other's perspectives better and work through the issue. This, however, can be difficult during emotionally charged times, so approaching the conversation when you both feel calm and ready might be useful. It may also help to seek advice or support from a counselor or therapist who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation."

. **Consider Talking to Someone:** If you're struggling with these feelings, talking to a friend or mental health professional can be helpful.

It's important to prioritize your own emotional health and ensure you're in a situation that respects and values you."

My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying I have mood swings They have no proof to back it up Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice,"If your coworkers are making false statements about you having mood swings, it is important to address the situation promptly and professionally.

. **Company Policies**: Review your company’s policies regarding workplace disputes and mental health. Most organizations have guidelines on how such matters are addressed.

Regarding your employer mandating therapy:

. **Employment Contract**: Check your employment contract to see if there are any clauses about mandatory health evaluations or similar requirements.

. **Rights and Protections**: In many jurisdictions, employers cannot force employees to see a therapist unless it is stipulated in a contract, or there is a significant concern about workplace safety directly linked to behavior. Often this would also require consultations with HR and legal teams.

. **Medical Privacy**: You have a right to medical privacy, and unless there are explicit concerns about your ability to perform your job or a direct threat to workplace safety, mandating therapy could be seen as a violation of your privacy.

. **Legal Advice**: If you feel pressured, it might be beneficial to seek legal advice to understand your rights specific to your jurisdiction and situation.

It's great that you value the friendship and want to maintain it, but taking care of your emotional well-being is also crucial. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to be honest with yourself about your emotions. Accept that these feelings exist, and it's okay to feel this way.

. **Set Boundaries**: Since physical touch is maintaining your feelings, consider setting boundaries regarding hugs or other physical interactions. You can express needing some space or limiting certain interactions without jeopardizing the friendship.

. **Reduce Contact Temporarily**: While it might not be possible to completely avoid him, try to limit non-essential interactions. This might help you start seeing him more as a friend and less as a romantic interest.

. **Focus on Yourself**: Engage in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. Strengthening other areas of your life might help shift your focus away from him.

. **Reflect on the Relationship**: Consider what it is about him and your interaction that keeps you hooked. Reflecting on these aspects might highlight areas you can find in other people or situations.

. **Communicate with Him**: If you feel comfortable, a candid conversation about your feelings might provide you with closure. Understanding his perspective can sometimes help you reshape your expectations.

. **Seek Support**: Sometimes discussing your feelings with a trusted friend or therapist can provide new insights and support to help you move forward.

. **Explore New Connections**: Meeting new people and forming new connections can help distract you and provide perspective.

I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two It usually happens in bed at night but I occasionally experience this during the day I have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this,"I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing these symptoms. While I can't diagnose or give medical advice, I can suggest a few considerations that you might discuss with your healthcare provider.

. **Stress and Anxiety**: Sometimes, stress or anxiety can lead to physical symptoms like excessive swallowing or feeling ""out of body."" You might want to consider whether stress could be a triggering factor for you.

. **GERD or Acid Reflux**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease or acid reflux can cause a sensation of needing to swallow repeatedly. It might be worth discussing this possibility with your doctor.

. **Neurological Factors**: Even though your doctor mentioned that your tumor is not associated with these symptoms, it might still be worthwhile to have a discussion about other neurological factors, especially if your symptoms persist or worsen.

I went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide When I went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that I put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders He was very angry that I went to him to do that Am I in the wrong for going to him to reach out He helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why I thought of him to reach out He made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help Why did he react this way towards me I think hes being selfish,"It sounds like a difficult situation for everyone involved. It's important to recognize that your ex-boyfriend might have reacted the way he did for a few reasons:

. **Emotional Burden**: Suicide is a very sensitive and serious issue, and being asked to intervene could have been overwhelming for him emotionally, especially if he is not in regular contact with that friend anymore.

. **Past Relationship Dynamics**: Your past relationship with him might add complexity to the situation. He might have felt that his involvement would blur boundaries that have been established since your breakup.

. **Feeling Undue Pressure**: He might have felt pressured or unprepared to handle such a serious situation, particularly if he doesn't feel equipped to support someone in crisis.

. **Feeling Responsible**: Being asked to help someone in a life-threatening situation can make a person feel like they are being given an enormous responsibility, which can be very daunting.

Your intent was clearly to help, coming from a place of knowing how supportive he had been to you in the past. However, it's understandable that he might have felt put in an awkward or challenging position. You might consider reaching out to professionals, such as counselors or helplines, who are trained to help in these situations. Additionally, it might help to communicate with your ex-boyfriend about why you reached out to him and how you can both support his friend in more appropriate ways."
He told me he started to back away because I was asking for too much in the relationship The more I tried to fix things the worse it got I want to make us better again but I dont know how,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. Relationship challenges can be really tough. Here are a few steps you might consider taking to address the situation:

. **Reflect on His Feedback**: Take some time to think about what he meant by ""asking for too much."" Try to identify any specific behaviors or expectations he might be referring to. This can help you understand his perspective better.

. **Communicate Openly**: Reach out to him for an open and honest conversation. Let him know that you want to understand how he feels, and be prepared to listen without getting defensive. Express your feelings too, and try to find a middle ground.

. **Identify Your Needs**: Consider what you truly need from the relationship and assess whether those needs are realistic and reasonable. It's important to be clear about what you want without compromising who you are.

. **Make Adjustments**: If there are specific changes you can make to address his concerns, be willing to try them. However, ensure these changes are fair to both of you and that you're not sacrificing your own needs or values disproportionately.

. **Give It Time**: Sometimes, people need space to process their feelings. If you sense that he needs some time apart, respect that boundary and focus on self-care in the meantime.

. **Consider Counseling**: If the relationship is important to both of you and you're both willing, couples counseling can be extremely effective. A professional can provide guidance and help facilitate communication between you two.

. **Evaluate the Relationship**: Reflect on whether the relationship is making you both happy. Relationships should provide support and fulfillment, so it's important to ensure that it benefits both of you in a healthy, balanced way.

Remember, you can only control your own actions and responses. It takes effort from both partners to make a relationship work, so be sure to look after your well-being and interests along the way."
My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide He says that because his dad died so did his heart He says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again Why is he doing this when we were very happy together He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me,"I'm really sorry to hear that you and your boyfriend are going through such a difficult time. It's important to understand that grief, especially when it involves the loss of a loved one to suicide, can be incredibly complex and overwhelming. Here are a few things that might help explain what he's going through:

. **Intense Grief:** Losing a parent, particularly in such a tragic way, can cause a person to experience intense grief and emotions that are difficult to manage. He may feel numb, disconnected, or in emotional pain.

. **Emotional Overload:** He might feel like he is in a state of emotional overload and unable to handle additional emotional responsibilities, including being in a relationship.

. **Self-Protection:** Sometimes, people pull away from those they care about as a way to protect themselves or their loved ones from their own perceived instability or to avoid dealing with the additional emotional stress.

. **Guilt and Confusion:** He might be experiencing feelings of guilt, confusion, or self-blame, trying to make sense of what happened, and may feel incapable of being the partner he wants to be for you.

. **Need for Space:** It's possible he needs space to process his loss and emotions without the added complexity of maintaining a relationship.

While it's painful, respecting his request for space might be the best support you can offer right now. Encourage him to seek professional help, such as grief counseling, which can provide guidance and support through such a profound loss. Consider seeking support for yourself, too, as this situation impacts both of you deeply. Remember, people grieve differently, and while he may need time apart, it doesn't mean he won't eventually process his grief and be able to reconnect."

. **Encourage Counseling**: Suggesting couples counseling might be beneficial. A neutral third party can help facilitate healthier communication and address underlying issues.

. **Ask for His Perspective**: Try to understand his point of view. There might be reasons for his behavior that you aren't aware of, such as past experiences, personal comfort levels, or other issues.

. **Express Your Needs**: Clearly express what you need from the relationship to feel fulfilled and ask if there is a way to work on these issues together.

. **Evaluate the Relationship**: Reflect on the overall relationship, considering whether your needs and his behaviors are compatible in the long term.

. **Seek Counseling**: If the issues persist and communication alone doesn't lead to understanding and improvement, consider seeking guidance from a relationship therapist. They can offer strategies and support for both of you.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and finding a resolution that respects both partners' needs is important in any relationship."
He said that if I were to visit my mother he will be gone when I get back My boyfriend and I hit a rough patch in our relationship a few months back and my mom had a few choice words with him,"It sounds like you're facing a complex and emotionally challenging situation. Balancing relationships with loved ones, especially during difficult times, can be tough. Here are a few things you might consider:

. **Communication**: Talk openly with your boyfriend about how both of you are feeling. It might help to address any underlying issues and clarify intentions. Understanding each other's perspectives can sometimes help resolve tension.

. **Counseling**: If possible, consider seeking couples counseling. A professional can help both of you navigate this rough patch and communicate more effectively.

I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out    How can I approach them about it should I hold back and keep it a secret or should I just be upfront about it I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy What should I do,"Navigating relationships while staying true to yourself can be challenging, particularly when aspects of your identity might not fit conventional expectations. Here's some advice on how to approach this situation:

. **Embrace Your Identity**: First and foremost, recognize that there's nothing wrong with enjoying cross-dressing and expressing your femininity. It's important to embrace what makes you happy and feel authentic.

. **Self-Acceptance**: Before approaching others, make sure you fully accept and feel confident about your identity. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the easier it will be to communicate this to others.

. **Be Upfront Early On**: Consider discussing your interest in cross-dressing and your feminine side early in your connection with someone. While you don't need to bring it up on a first date, if you feel a relationship developing, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation. This can help ensure that you're both on the same page and avoid misunderstandings later.

. **Approach With Confidence**: When you do bring it up, talk about it with confidence. Explain that it’s an important part of who you are, and it makes you happy. Assure them that your attraction to women remains unchanged.

. **Gauge Their Reaction**: Pay attention to their response. It’s okay if they need time to process or have questions. However, if they respond negatively or with judgment, consider whether that relationship is worth pursuing further.

. **Respect Their Perspective**: Understand that everyone has their own preferences and comfort levels. If someone you're interested in isn't comfortable with cross-dressing, it's important to respect their perspective even if it means moving on.

. **Find Supportive Communities**: Engage with communities or groups that support cross-dressing. This can provide you with a supportive network and possibly introduce you to people who are more understanding and open to different forms of expression.

. **Stay True to Yourself**: Ultimately, it’s important to be true to yourself. Sacrificing your happiness and identity for a relationship usually isn’t sustainable in the long run.

Finding someone who appreciates you for who you are, including your love for cross-dressing, may take time. However, being genuine about this aspect of yourself can lead to healthier and more fulfilling relationships."
I love my girlfriend so much I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her But the two times we tried to have sex I couldnt get an erection Weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    Why this is happening and what can I do about it,"It sounds like you’re experiencing a form of erectile dysfunction (ED) that can occur in specific situations. This is not uncommon and can be influenced by a variety of factors. Here are a few possibilities and suggestions for addressing this issue:

. **Performance Anxiety**: This is one of the most common psychological causes of ED, especially in new or less frequently occurring sexual situations. You might be putting pressure on yourself to perform well, leading to anxiety that interferes with your ability to maintain an erection. 

. **Stress and Emotional Factors**: General stress, relationship stress, or other emotional factors can impact sexual performance. Open communication with your partner about your feelings and concerns can help alleviate some of this stress.

. **Physical Factors**: While you can get an erection in some situations but not during intercourse, it’s still worth considering physical health as a factor. Lifestyle factors like sleep, diet, exercise, and substance use (alcohol, drugs, smoking) can also play a role.

. **Desensitization**: Sometimes, overthinking or focusing too much on having an erection can result in the opposite effect. Focusing on intimacy and enjoying the moment rather than the expectation of penetration can help alleviate this.

**What You Can Do:**

- **Communication**: Talk openly with your girlfriend about what you’re experiencing. This can relieve pressure and foster intimacy and understanding between you two.

- **Relaxation Techniques**: Practices like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help reduce anxiety and stress.

- **Spend More Time on Foreplay**: Focusing on non-penetrative sex can help reduce pressure and increase intimacy, which might make it easier to get and maintain an erection.

- **Seek Professional Help**: If the problem persists, consider speaking with a healthcare professional or a therapist. Sometimes, addressing the psychological or medical underpinnings directly can be beneficial.

- **Healthy Lifestyle**: Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly.

Remember, experiencing this is quite common, and finding a solution often involves a combination of psychological and lifestyle factors."

My boyfriend and I recently broke up One week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space He completely deleted me out of his life He does have an opiate addiction He claimed he was sober but since weve split Ive heard many lies from him Could he be using again and does this addiction affect the mind,"I'm sorry to hear about your difficult situation. It's possible that your boyfriend's behavior and the sudden change in your relationship could be influenced by his addiction. Opiate addiction can significantly impact a person's behavior and mental health. Here are a few ways it might affect him:

. **Mood Swings and Emotional Instability**: Opiate use, withdrawal, or even the desire to use can cause mood swings and emotional changes, which might explain his sudden need for space or decision to disconnect.

. **Deception and Secretive Behavior**: It's common for individuals with addictions to become secretive or deceptive to hide their use, which might relate to the lies you're hearing.

. **Cognitive Impairment**: Long-term opiate use can affect cognitive functions, including memory and decision-making, potentially leading to erratic or inconsistent behavior.

. **Isolation**: People struggling with addiction may isolate themselves from loved ones, partly due to shame or the fear of being judged.

. **Relapse Risk**: If he claimed to be sober but is experiencing stress or emotional turmoil, there might be a risk of relapse.

If you're concerned about his well-being, and if it's safe and appropriate to do so, consider encouraging him to seek support from addiction professionals or support groups. However, it's also important to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries in this situation. If you need support for yourself, reaching out to a counselor or support group can be beneficial."

Shes my stepmom Im pretty sure shes illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad,"It's important to approach sensitive situations like this carefully and thoughtfully. If you have concerns about illegal activities, especially those involving substance abuse, consider the following steps:

. **Gather Information**: Make sure your concerns are based on reliable information. Avoid jumping to conclusions without evidence.

My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned She calls me every day complaining but I dont want to hear it anymore,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation. Here are some steps you might consider taking to help manage the situation:

. **Set Boundaries**: It’s important to establish boundaries with your mother if her complaints are becoming too much for you. You can let her know that while you empathize with her situation, listening to her complaints every day is overwhelming. Suggest setting specific times when you can discuss these issues, which might help reduce the frequency of conversations.

. **Redirect Conversations**: If the calls become too negative, gently redirect the conversation to more neutral or positive topics. This can help shift the focus and mood of your interactions.

Balancing family dynamics can be challenging, but clear communication and defined boundaries can help make the situation more manageable. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to seek support for yourself as well."

"My dad doesnt like the fact that Im a boy He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me Im extreme and over dramatic
   I get so depressed because of my dads yelling He keeps asking me why I cant just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis Is this considered emotional abuse","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a very tough situation. Emotional abuse can take many forms, and it often involves patterns of behavior aimed at undermining someone's self-worth or emotional well-being. Yelling, constant criticism, and dismissing your feelings could fall into that category, particularly if they leave you feeling depressed and anxious.

It's important to take your feelings seriously and seek support. Consider talking to a trusted adult, such as another family member, teacher, or counselor, about what you're experiencing. They might be able to provide guidance or help you find resources to improve your situation. Remember, it's okay to reach out for help, and you deserve to feel safe and supported."
"How do I ever trust another woman I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions
 Once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application","I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. Trust issues, especially stemming from a past relationship where you felt manipulated or hurt, can be deeply challenging to overcome. Here are some steps that might help you rebuild trust and foster connections:

. **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define what you’re comfortable with in new relationships. Having boundaries can help you feel safer and more in control, which could help alleviate some of the anxiety around trusting others.

. **Communicate Openly:** When you feel ready to connect with someone new, practice open communication. Express your concerns and past experiences if it feels appropriate. People who are worth trusting will respect your boundaries and understand your hesitations.

. **Take it Slow:** There’s no rush to form deep connections. Take your time to get to know people gradually. Trust is built over time, through consistent and respectful behavior.

. **Seek Support:** Talk to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with strategies to rebuild trust and manage anxiety. Professional guidance can be instrumental in navigating complex emotions and past traumas.

. **Learn to Trust Yourself:** Sometimes rebuilding trust in others starts with trusting yourself and your instincts. You’ve learned from your past experience, and trusting that you can make better decisions in the future can be empowering.

. **Focus on Positive Relationships:** Surround yourself with people who demonstrate honesty, integrity, and reliability. Positive relationships can reinforce that not everyone is untrustworthy.

. **Consider Legal Advice:** If you’re concerned about legal issues related to false claims, it might be worth seeking legal advice to understand your situation and any possible repercussions.

Remember, healing from such experiences takes time, and it’s important to be patient with yourself. Every step forward is progress."

She is living with her boyfriend of seven years He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety He hasnt worked in all this time,"It sounds like your friend is in a challenging situation. Supporting a partner with mental health issues like depression and social anxiety can be difficult, especially if it impacts their ability to work. It’s important for both partners to communicate openly about their feelings and needs.

I keep being mean to my best friend and I dont know why all the time I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time Could that be a cause,"It's possible that your behavior towards your best friend might be influenced by the way your mother treats you. People often internalize and mimic behaviors they experience in significant relationships, especially family dynamics. If you're regularly subjected to meanness or criticism, you might unconsciously replicate those patterns in other relationships, including with close friends.

Understanding the root cause of your behavior is an important first step. Here are a few things you might consider doing:

. **Reflect**: Take some time to think about specific instances when you've been mean to your friend. What triggered those actions? Are there any patterns in your behavior or in the circumstances?

. **Communicate**: Talk to your friend about your feelings and behavior. Apologizing and explaining that you’re trying to understand and change can help repair the relationship.

. **Seek Support**: Consider speaking with a counselor or therapist. They can help you work through your feelings towards your mother and learn healthier ways to manage relationships.

. **Practice Empathy and Self-awareness**: Try to put yourself in your friend's shoes and be aware of how your actions affect them. Being mindful can help you catch yourself before reacting harshly.

. **Work on Coping Strategies**: Find alternative ways to deal with stress or frustration that stem from your relationship with your mother, such as journaling, exercising, or engaging in a hobby.

. **Set Boundaries**: If possible, consider establishing boundaries with your mother to protect your emotional well-being.

Recognizing the influence of family dynamics on personal behavior is a significant step towards personal growth and improving your relationships."
My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and I cant seem to forgive her I want to say that its okay but I cant I feel like even if I did forgive her I wouldnt be able to say it to her face,"It's completely normal to have complex feelings when it comes to forgiveness, especially when it involves someone as significant as your mom. Forgiveness is often more about personal healing rather than excusing the other person's behavior. It's okay to take your time in processing these emotions.

Here are a few steps that might help you on this journey:

. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Take some time to understand what exactly is holding you back from forgiving her. Is it the hurt she caused, a breach of trust, or something else? Journaling or speaking to a therapist can be helpful in clarifying these feelings.

. **Understand Her Perspective**: This doesn’t mean justifying her actions, but sometimes trying to see things from her perspective can soften your feelings. Consider what circumstances might have led to her mistakes.

. **Set Boundaries**: Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to tolerate behavior that continues to harm you. Reflect on what boundaries you need to set to protect yourself, and communicate those if needed.

. **Communicate in Your Own Way**: If you're not ready to express forgiveness face-to-face, consider writing her a letter. You don’t have to send it. This can help you organize and express your thoughts and feelings.

. **Focus on Healing**: Engage in activities that promote self-care and emotional healing. Whether it's through meditation, spending time with supportive friends, or pursuing hobbies, prioritize your well-being.

. **Seek Professional Help**: If these feelings seem too overwhelming to handle alone, consider reaching out to a therapist. They can offer guidance and support as you work through your emotions.

Remember, forgiveness is a personal journey, and there’s no rush. It’s important to move at a pace that feels right for you."

I am always arguing with my father He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling I get upset often at this Am I too sensitive He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings No matter how often I try to tell him this he never listens,"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel upset when someone speaks to you in a way that feels harsh or demanding. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and not dismiss them as being ""too sensitive."" Everyone has different emotional thresholds, and what feels hurtful to you is valid.

Here are a few steps you might consider to improve the communication with your father:

. **Choose the Right Time:** Try to talk to your father when neither of you is stressed or preoccupied. This might help in having a more calm and productive conversation.

. **Use ""I"" Statements:** When discussing how his tone affects you, try to frame it in terms of how it makes you feel. For example, ""I feel upset when I'm spoken to in a demanding tone,"" instead of ""You are always yelling at me."" This can make him less defensive and more open to understanding your perspective.

. **Express Empathy:** Acknowledge that you understand he is stressed about work and health, and that you want to support him. This can help him feel understood, which might make him more receptive to your concerns.

. **Set Boundaries:** It's important to communicate what is acceptable and what isn't. Let him know when his way of speaking crosses a line for you. Boundaries can help establish mutual respect.

. **Seek Support:** Consider talking to another family member, a counselor, or a friend for additional support and perspective. They might offer insights or strategies that you haven't considered.

. **Focus on Solutions:** Try to work together towards a solution once the initial concerns have been expressed. Perhaps there are ways to alleviate his stress or improve how you communicate with each other.

. **Be Patient:** Changing communication patterns can take time. Continue to express your feelings calmly and consistently, and be patient with the process.

Remember, it's important to take care of your emotional health and to seek help if you need it. Talking to a counselor or therapist can provide additional guidance tailored to your situation."

. **Psychological Issues**: Sometimes, inappropriate urination can be a symptom of underlying psychological problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression. Individuals may struggle with impulse control, experience confusion, or have disrupted perceptions of social norms.

. **Substance Abuse**: The use of drugs or alcohol can lead to impaired judgment and loss of inhibition, causing individuals to act inappropriately.

. **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, especially those affecting the urinary tract or brain functions, could contribute to uncontrolled or inappropriate urination.

. **Attention-Seeking or Power Dynamics**: In some cases, individuals might engage in such behavior to exert control, assert dominance, or express underlying conflicts or frustrations within the family dynamic.

. **Social or Environmental Factors**: Sometimes, a stressful or hostile environment can lead individuals to act out in unusual ways. It might also be a response to perceived disrespect or conflict within the household.

. **Lack of Awareness of Social Norms**: Certain developmental disorders or cognitive impairments can result in difficulties understanding appropriate social behavior.

Addressing this issue will likely require a sensitive and careful approach. Here are some potential steps you could consider taking:

- **Open Communication**: Have a private and respectful conversation with the individuals involved to express your concerns and understand their perspective.

- **Professional Help**: Encourage them to seek professional help if you suspect psychological or medical issues. Involving a mental health professional might provide insight and solutions.

- **Set Boundaries**: Clearly establish and communicate boundaries within your home regarding acceptable behavior.

- **Family Mediation or Therapy**: If the issue is rooted in family dynamics, a professional mediator or family therapist might help in resolving underlying conflicts.

If the behavior persists or escalates, you may need to consider more assertive measures to protect your home and well-being."
I started dating a guy I met online He told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years That was more than two decades ago Nothing on his record since I always believe the past should be left in past But my roommates their family and my son are unforgiving Should I forgive this man that Im falling in love with or should I dump him If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again,"This is a complex and deeply personal decision, and it's important to consider several factors:

. **Understand the Circumstances**: Try to gain a thorough understanding of the circumstances surrounding his conviction. It might also help to consult legal documents or professionals to better comprehend the situation.

. **Evaluate His Current Behavior**: Consider his behavior and actions over the past two decades. Has he demonstrated change and rehabilitation? Does he have a supportive network and a stable lifestyle?

. **Consider the Impact on Your Relationships**: Assess how this relationship will affect your other important relationships, especially with your family and granddaughter. Is there a way to facilitate dialogue to help them understand your perspective?

. **Reflect on Your Values and Priorities**: Reflect on what you value more – your relationship with him or your relationship with your family. This might require some deep introspection regarding your priorities and long-term goals.

. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a neutral space for you to explore your feelings and concerns in more depth.

. **Plan for the Future**: Think about the potential scenarios and challenges that might arise moving forward, helping you make a more informed decision.

Ultimately, it’s essential to do what feels right for you, ensuring that your choice aligns with your values and the kind of life you envision for yourself."
Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,"Improving communication in a relationship can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can try to encourage more balanced and attentive dialogue with your husband:

. **Express Your Needs Clearly**: Start by having an open and honest conversation about how you feel. Let him know that you feel unheard and express your desire for more balanced communication.

. **Choose the Right Time**: Find a moment when both of you are calm and free from distractions. Avoid starting this conversation during a stressful or busy time.

. **Use ""I"" Statements**: Instead of focusing on what he’s doing wrong, express how his behavior makes you feel. For example, say ""I feel like I'm not being heard"" instead of ""You never listen to me.""

. **Be Specific**: Provide specific examples of times when you felt unheard. This can help him understand and recognize patterns.

. **Encourage Active Listening**: Ask him to repeat back what you’ve said to ensure he’s understanding your perspective. This is a common active listening practice that can improve understanding.

. **Set Boundaries**: If you feel that conversations often get dominated by his issues or subjects, gently steer the conversation back and share the floor.

. **Seek Feedback**: Invite him to share how he perceives the situation. This might reveal mutual misunderstandings or areas where both of you can improve.

. **Practice Empathy**: Encourage empathy by discussing how each of you interprets listening in a relationship. Understanding his view might provide insights into how to bridge the gap.

. **Create Rituals for Sharing**: Establish a regular time when both of you sit down to talk and listen to each other about your day or any pressing matters. Making it a routine can emphasize its importance.

. **Consider Counseling**: If these strategies don’t lead to change, consider seeking the advice of a couples therapist. A professional can offer guidance and techniques tailored to your specific situation.

Remember, improving communication takes time and effort from both parties. Encouraging him to listen better is a collaborative process that requires patience and persistence."
If I tell him I dont like certain things he does when it pertains to me He tells me its not like that He never has anything to say about me until I tell him something about himself,"It sounds like you are dealing with a challenging situation in communication. When you express your feelings or concerns about certain things he does, and he responds by dismissing your perspective or deflecting the issue, it can be frustrating and unproductive. Here are a few approaches you might consider to improve the situation:

. **Be Specific and Use ""I"" Statements**: When discussing your feelings, use specific examples and ""I"" statements to focus on your perspective instead of accusing him. For example, ""I feel uncomfortable when XYZ happens"" rather than ""You always do XYZ.""

. **Set a Calm Tone**: Approach the conversation when you’re both calm and not in the middle of an argument. This can help prevent defensiveness and keep the focus on understanding each other.

. **Active Listening**: Encourage a two-way dialogue by actively listening to his perspective as well. Acknowledge his feelings and try to understand his point of view while also expressing your needs.

. **Seek Common Ground**: Look for areas of agreement or mutual understanding. This can help both of you feel more connected and less adversarial.

. **Express the Impact**: Explain how his actions impact you and the relationship. Sometimes understanding the consequences can motivate someone to make changes.

. **Request Feedback**: Ask if there are things you do that might bother him. This can open up the dialogue for mutual self-improvement and show that you’re willing to work on things too.

. **Suggest Solutions**: Offer possible solutions or compromises and invite him to suggest changes. This can shift the conversation from a critique to a team effort to improve the relationship.

. **Consider Mediation**: If these conversations are recurrent and don’t lead to improvement, consider seeking a neutral third party, such as a counselor or mediator, to facilitate a more constructive dialogue.

Ultimately, healthy communication involves both partners feeling heard and respected. It may take time and patience to achieve this, but with consistent effort, it can lead to a stronger, more understanding relationship."
My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia I have been dealing with that all day My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said,"I'm really sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis. That's an incredibly tough situation to be in, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. When dealing with such stress, communication in relationships can become strained. It might help to have an open conversation with your husband about what you're going through and express how the situation is affecting you. He may not fully understand the level of stress you're under, so sharing your feelings might help him support you more effectively.

Here are a few suggestions for approaching the conversation:

. **Choose the Right Time**: Find a moment when you both are relatively calm and not distracted.

. **Express Your Feelings**: Let him know how you're feeling. You might say something like, ""I've been really overwhelmed and stressed because of my dad's situation.""

. **Acknowledge the Tension**: Mention the tension you've noticed. For example, ""I've noticed that we've been disagreeing more lately.""

. **Ask for Support**: Let him know how he can support you better, whether that's through patience, a listening ear, or just understanding your current state of mind.

. **Listen to His Perspective**: Allow him to share his feelings too; he might have stressors that he's not expressing well.

Remember, it's important to be gentle with yourself during this time. You are dealing with a lot, and it's okay to seek support from people around you, whether it's friends, family, or a counselor."
Im feeling different towards my husband I feel I am growing from the relationship I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five I just dont feel that connection anymore I feel nothing I dont know why or if Im just being irrational,"It's understandable to feel confused or concerned when your feelings towards your spouse change. Relationships can evolve over time, and it's not uncommon for partners to experience shifts in their emotional connections. Here are a few steps you might consider taking to better understand what you're feeling:

. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Take some time to reflect on your emotions and try to identify any specific reasons why you might be feeling disconnected. Consider whether there have been any recent changes in your life, relationship, or personal growth that might have influenced your feelings.

. **Open Communication**: Consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about how you're feeling. Share your thoughts and concerns without placing blame, and encourage him to share his feelings as well. This can help both of you understand each other's perspectives and work together to address any issues.

. **Seek Professional Support**: If you're finding it difficult to navigate these feelings on your own, consider seeking the guidance of a therapist or counselor. A professional can help you explore your emotions, improve communication, and identify potential paths forward.

. **Evaluate Your Needs**: Think about what you need in a relationship to feel fulfilled and connected. Are there specific areas where you feel your needs aren't being met? Understanding your own needs can help guide conversations with your husband and determine if there are ways to rekindle your connection.

. **Quality Time Together**: Sometimes, daily routines and responsibilities can create distance between partners. Try to intentionally spend quality time together, whether it's through date nights, shared hobbies, or simply enjoying each other's company, to rebuild your connection.

. **Personal Growth and Space**: Ensure you're taking care of your own personal growth and interests. Sometimes, focusing on personal development can lead to a renewed perspective on your relationship.

Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain about your feelings, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through them. Each relationship is unique, and finding the right solution for your situation may take time and effort."
That phrase makes me crazy It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie Another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up Over and over again he lets the dog run out and I am afraid he will get hit by a car,"It sounds like you're dealing with some communication and attention issues in your relationship, which can be really frustrating. It's important for both partners to feel heard and understood. Here are a few strategies that might help:

. **Choose the Right Time**: Try addressing your concerns when you're both calm and not distracted. Avoid bringing up issues when he's already engaged in something else, like using his iPad.

. **Use ""I"" Statements**: This can make your message less confrontational. For example, ""I feel worried when the dog runs out because I'm afraid he might get hurt.""

. **Be Specific and Direct**: Clearly state what action or change you need. Instead of implying he should be more attentive, directly ask for his attention when you’re speaking about important matters.

. **Highlight Consequences**: Emphasize how these changes can prevent negative outcomes, such as the dog running out and possibly getting hurt.

. **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge and appreciate when he does pay attention or takes action. Positive feedback can encourage more of the behavior you want to see.

. **Set Agreements**: Try to establish some agreements about specific behaviors, such as always holding the dog when the door is opened.

. **Seek Mediation**: If these issues persist, it might be helpful to engage a neutral third party, like a counselor, to facilitate better communication.

Remember, it's important for both of you to be open and willing to work on these issues for the relationship to improve."
My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad It was a time when my health was poor Im have a hard time moving on,"I'm truly sorry to hear about what you're going through. It sounds incredibly painful to experience both betrayal and health challenges simultaneously. Healing from such experiences takes time and self-compassion.

. **Allow Yourself to Feel:** It's important to acknowledge and validate your emotions. It's normal to feel hurt, angry, or confused. Give yourself permission to feel these emotions without judgment.

. **Seek Support:** Consider reaching out to friends or family members you trust, or joining a support group. Sometimes sharing your feelings with others who can empathize can be comforting.

. **Professional Help:** Therapy or counseling can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. A mental health professional can offer guidance tailored to your specific situation.

. **Reflect on What You Need:** Take time to consider what you need to heal and how you want to move forward, whether that's working on rebuilding trust, separating, or something else.

. **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be gentle with yourself during this time. Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to have good and bad days.

. **Engage in Activities You Enjoy:** Rediscover hobbies or activities that bring you joy or a sense of accomplishment. This might provide a distraction and remind you of your personal interests and strengths.

Remember, you are not alone, and it's okay to ask for help. Take things one day at a time, and give yourself credit for the progress you make, no matter how small it seems."
I have no self control over food Most people stop when theyve had enough but I keep eating for the pleasure of it Especially with sweets  Im never done eating dessert,"It sounds like you're experiencing challenges with regulating your eating habits, particularly around sweets and desserts. Here are some strategies that might help you gain more control:

. **Mindful Eating**: Try to eat more mindfully by paying close attention to the taste, texture, and aroma of your food. This can help you enjoy your food more and recognize when you're full.

. **Identify Triggers**: Keep a food diary to track what and when you eat, as well as your emotions at the time. This may help you identify patterns and triggers that lead to overeating.

. **Portion Control**: Serve smaller portions of desserts and sweets to help limit your intake. Using smaller plates can also trick your brain into feeling satisfied with less.

. **Balanced Diet**: Ensure you're eating balanced meals throughout the day, including plenty of protein, fiber, and healthy fats, which can help keep you feeling full and reduce cravings.

. **Limit Temptations**: Keep sweets and desserts out of the house or in a less accessible place to make it harder to reach for them impulsively.

. **Seek Alternatives**: Find healthier alternatives to satisfy your sweet tooth, such as fruit or yogurt with honey.

. **Structured Eating**: Establish regular meal and snack times to prevent extreme hunger, which can lead to overeating.

. **Mindful Substitution**: If you’re craving dessert, try to fill half your plate with fruits which add fiber and nutrients.

. **Professional Help**: Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor, particularly one who specializes in eating behaviors, to explore underlying issues and develop coping strategies.

. **Support Groups**: Joining a support group can offer you a community of people who understand what you’re going through and can offer encouragement and advice.

Remember, it’s important to be kind to yourself and recognize that changing habits takes time and effort."

"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong","Whether or not you were wrong depends on various factors, including the boundaries and expectations within your current relationship, as well as the level of trust and communication you have with your boyfriend. Here are some points to consider:

. **Communication:** Did you discuss your friendship with your ex and your plans to spend time with him with your boyfriend beforehand? Open and honest communication is key in maintaining trust in a relationship.

. **Boundaries:** Every relationship has its own set of boundaries. Have you and your boyfriend discussed what is comfortable for both of you regarding spending time with ex-partners? 

. **Intentions and Transparency:** What were your intentions and how transparent were you with your boyfriend about the weekend? Being upfront can help alleviate any feelings of jealousy or insecurity.

. **Trust:** Does your boyfriend generally trust you, and do you trust him? If there are underlying trust issues, they might need to be addressed independently of this situation.

. **Feelings and Reassurance:** How you handle your boyfriend's feelings also matters. Acknowledging and reassuring him can demonstrate your respect and commitment to the relationship.

Ultimately, resolving this situation will likely involve a conversation where you both express your feelings, listen to each other, and find a compromise that respects both your friendship and your romantic relationship."

. **Be Mindful of Body Language:**
   - Keep your body language open and inviting.
   - Avoid crossing your arms or looking away.

Im in a longdistance relationship with my ideal man but Im not as attracted to him as I should be Everything else is perfect about him but I find myself lusting over more attractive men The next step is marriage but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again However I also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust Am I asking for too much in the perfect guy Is there such a thing Am I truly in love,"Navigating feelings in a long-distance relationship can be particularly challenging, especially when it comes to evaluating physical attraction and long-term compatibility. It's essential to consider multiple facets of your situation:

. **Understanding Attraction**: Physical attraction is a significant component of romantic relationships, but it often fluctuates over time. Emotional and intellectual connections may offer a deeper foundation for lasting love. Reflect on whether your lack of attraction is due to the distance, or if this is how you might feel even if you were together regularly.

. **Lust vs. Love**: It's natural to feel attraction to other people, even when you're in a committed relationship. However, distinguishing lust from love is crucial. Lust is often temporary and focused on physical appearance, whereas love encompasses a holistic appreciation for the person's qualities, including their emotional connection with you.

. **The Ideal Partner**: No one is perfect, and relationships require compromise. Consider what aspects are non-negotiable for you and what you might be willing to work through. It's important to recognize if you are idealizing an unattainable perfect partner.

. **Self-Reflection**: Ask yourself if the lack of attraction is a dealbreaker or if it's something you can grow or work on. Consider the long-term happiness and fulfillment you derive from the relationship outside of physical attraction.

. **Communication**: Open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings is key. Discussing your concerns might help you both understand where you stand and explore solutions together.

. **Seeking Guidance**: Sometimes, talking with a therapist or a relationship counselor can provide objective insights and help you explore your feelings more deeply.

Ultimately, whether you're truly in love is a question only you can answer. Understanding your priorities, values, and feelings will guide you in making the best decision for your future."
I met this girl in high school She had switched schools at the end of the year and I have not seen her since Its been a few years We had a very good and friendly relationship and we seemed to have a lot in common I never gained the courage to ask her out,"If you're interested in reconnecting with her, there are a few steps you could take:

. **Social Media**: Try searching for her on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. Many people use their real names on these platforms, which might make it easier to find her.

. **Mutual Friends**: If you had mutual friends back in high school, reach out to them. They might have information about her current whereabouts and can help you reconnect.

. **School Contacts**: Sometimes, schools have alumni networks or events. You could see if your high school has any events coming up that she might attend.

. **Be Genuine**: If you do manage to get in touch, be genuine and straightforward about why you’re reaching out. You can express that you enjoyed your friendship and would like to catch up to see how she's been.

. **Take It Slow**: Reconnect as friends first. If there’s mutual interest, the opportunity to ask her out may naturally arise.

I was never single afraid to be alone and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy I finally worked on my self was in a relationship and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didnt work out Now months later no man peaks my interest Am I ready to date again Is there a reason no one sparks my interest,"Feeling uninterested in dating after a breakup is a common experience. It’s great that you have taken the time to work on yourself and seek personal growth. Here are some things to consider when reflecting on your readiness to date again and why no one might be sparking your interest:

. **Time for Healing**: After any relationship ends, it's essential to give yourself time to heal emotionally. This can sometimes take longer than expected, and it's okay to take your time.

. **Self-awareness**: You've mentioned working on yourself and being a healthy partner, which is commendable. This self-awareness might mean you have higher standards now and are more selective about who you let into your life.

. **Priorities and Goals**: Your personal goals may have shifted since your last relationship. You might be more focused on self-improvement, career, hobbies, or other aspects of your life rather than dating.

. **Emotional Readiness**: Sometimes, a lack of interest in dating can signal that you're not emotionally ready to open up to a new relationship. Give yourself permission to enjoy your own company and pursue your passions without the pressure of dating.

. **Exploration of Interests**: Use this time to explore new activities, meet new people in different contexts, and further understand what qualities are most important to you in a partner.

. **Intuition and Gut Feelings**: Trust your instincts. If no one sparks your interest right now, it might simply be because the right person hasn't come along yet.

Remember, there is no rush to start dating again. Focus on what makes you happy and fulfilled as an individual. When the time is right, and you feel ready, you'll likely notice a renewed interest in dating naturally."

I really like this guy and I think he likes me back but his sister is my bestfriend Im afraid that if I tell her I have a crush on her brother she would loose it I once told her I thought her brother was cute and she got really angry Ive gotten to know her brother better lately and Ive realized he may actually feel the same way I dont want to lose her friendship What do I do,"Navigating relationships when friends or family are involved can be tricky, so it's important to approach the situation thoughtfully. Here are some steps you might consider taking:

. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Before proceeding, make sure you're certain about your feelings for him and consider whether this is a serious interest or a temporary crush. Understanding the depth of your feelings will guide your decision-making process.

. **Gauge His Feelings**: Be sure about his feelings towards you. If you're not confident, it might be worth spending more time getting to know how he truly feels without making any declarations that might complicate things.

. **Consider Her Perspective**: Try to understand why your best friend might be upset about you being interested in her brother. Is it protective instincts, past experiences, or something else? This understanding could help you approach the topic more sensitively.

. **Talk to Her Calmly**: If you decide to pursue this, have a calm and honest conversation with her. Reassure her that her friendship is important to you, and that your feelings for her brother developed naturally. Explain that you value her opinion and care about how she feels.

. **Set Boundaries**: If she reacts negatively, respect her feelings but also express your own. It's important to set boundaries about how her reaction will influence your decision.

. **Ask for Understanding**: Request that she tries to understand your position and reassure her that you wouldn't want to jeopardize either relationship. Sometimes, people need time to process such situations.

. **Be Prepared for Her Response**: Understand that she might need time to adjust to the idea, and her initial reaction might not be permanent. Give her space if needed.

. **Prioritize Both Relationships**: If she is staunchly against it, think carefully about whether you want to pursue the relationship with her brother. You might need to weigh which relationship holds more significance to you.

. **Be Honest with Her Brother**: If the feelings are mutual and you decide to proceed, be upfront with him about your concerns regarding his sister to see how he can help manage the situation.

. **Be Patient**: Often, time can ease tensions. Once initial emotions settle, she may become more accepting.

Remember, clear and empathetic communication is essential in these situations. Balancing relationships takes effort and understanding from all parties involved."

However, it doesn't necessarily mean that your fiancé is still in love with his ex. There could be several reasons why he suggested that hairstyle:

. **Aesthetic Preference**: He might simply like that particular hairstyle without consciously associating it with his ex.

. **Unconscious Influence**: People are often influenced by past experiences, sometimes without realizing it. It might be a coincidence.

. **Communication Opportunity**: This could be an opportunity to have an open, honest conversation about both of your feelings and any concerns you might have.

. **Seek Assurance**: Express how you feel and seek reassurance about your relationship and his feelings toward you.

. **Practice Active Listening**: Be prepared to listen as much as you speak. Pay attention to the other person's responses and acknowledge their feelings as well.

. **Nonverbal Communication**: Your body language, tone of voice, and eye contact can convey a lot. Ensure your nonverbal cues align with your words.

. **Seek Feedback**: After sharing your feelings, ask for feedback on how the conversation went. This can help you understand the other person's perspective and improve future interactions.

. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Building this skill takes time. Be kind to yourself as you learn and improve.

. **Emotional Needs**: Your emotional needs might not be met. You might be seeking empathy, understanding, or support, but not receiving these from your interactions.

. **Communication Gaps**: Sometimes people do care but aren't sure how to express it or how to support you in the way you need. They might say things like ""it will be okay"" thinking it's comforting, but it doesn't address what you're actually feeling.

. **Internal Factors**: Internal factors, like stress, anxiety, or depression, can also contribute to feelings of loneliness. These feelings can make it harder to connect with others.

. **Social Dynamics**: Friends and family may have their own challenges and might be less available than you'd like them to be.

Consider opening up to someone you trust about how you're truly feeling, or seeking support from a mental health professional who can provide a safe space to explore these feelings.

My boyfriend called me a particular profanity and I broke up with him This is the third time hes called me this and Im just completely done with giving him chances He knows how much it bothers me I just want to know if Im over reacting,"Breaking up with someone over repeated use of a profanity that you find hurtful is not an overreaction. Your feelings and boundaries are important, and it sounds like you communicated to him how much this behavior upset you. If he continued to disregard your feelings despite knowing the impact, then prioritizing your own well-being and deciding to end the relationship is a valid decision. It's crucial to be in a relationship where you feel respected and heard, and you shouldn't have to tolerate behavior that makes you feel otherwise.

Im in a relationship but I feel like Im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated My ex told me that I will never find anyone else and thats lingering in the back of my mind,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.

Im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend At the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart He is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but I dont really believe him    Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves    He knows that I still crush on him He doesnt rub it in my face Hes a good guy but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us How do I do that when the time comes How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up How do I make him feel better He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which I think is ridiculous,"It's thoughtful of you to want to support your friend during this confusing time. Here are some suggestions for how you can be there for him and help him navigate his feelings:

. **Listen Actively:** Let him express his feelings and thoughts without interruption or judgment. Sometimes, just being heard can make a big difference.

. **Empathize with His Situation:** Acknowledge that his feelings are valid, as relationships can be complicated, especially with the added dynamics of age and impending separation. Tell him it's okay to feel uncertain and conflicted.

. **Encourage Open Communication:** Suggest that he talk to Sally about his feelings and concerns. Open and honest communication can help them both understand each other's perspectives and potentially find a solution together.

. **Offer Practical Advice:** Share your thoughts on what might be meaningful gestures for Sally or how he could express his feelings in a way that suits his personality. It's important not to overstep, though, since every relationship is unique.

. **Support His Decision:** Whether he decides to stay with Sally or break up, respect his choice and reassure him that you'll be there for him regardless. Encourage him to make the decision that feels right for him.

. **Be There Post-Breakup:** If they do break up, spend time with him engaging in activities he enjoys. Help him to focus on positive aspects of life outside the relationship, like hobbies, friends, and new experiences.

. **Provide Perspective:** Gently remind him that feelings of heartbreak are temporary, and while it feels intense now, life will bring new opportunities and relationships.

. **Avoid Pressure:** Ensure that your support does not come with an expectation of starting a relationship with him soon after. Let things naturally progress without any pressure from either side.

. **Stay Balanced in Your Feelings:** While supporting him, take care of your emotions, too. It's okay to have a crush on him, but focus on being a good friend first.

By being a supportive friend, you can help him through this transition while possibly strengthening your bond for the future."

I had to go to the emergency room today to get an Xray of my spine My boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me Instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited When I was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up He doesnt understand why Im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things He thinks I dont have a reason to be mad but I believe that I do,"It's understandable that you're feeling upset. Being in the emergency room and dealing with medical issues can be stressful and having support from loved ones is important. You likely wanted your boyfriend there for emotional support, and it can feel hurtful when that support isn't provided in the way you hoped.

It's also common for couples to have different expectations about how they should support each other, especially in stressful situations. Your boyfriend might not have realized how important it was for you to have him there with you, or he might not see waiting with you as necessary. This discrepancy can lead to misunderstandings and feelings of being undervalued.

To move forward, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about why his absence bothered you and what you need from him in similar situations in the future. Try to express your feelings without blaming or accusing, using ""I"" statements to convey how his actions affected you emotionally. For example, ""I felt really alone and scared waiting by myself in the ER.""

Listening to his perspective is also important as it could help both of you understand each other's points of view better. Finding a compromise or understanding each other's expectations about support can help improve your relationship and prevent similar issues in the future."
My exboyfriend and I met over a year ago We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick However he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating When I found out I was pregnant we had just broken up Five months later I lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks Now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him again I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much and I want to get back to us being happy and a family,"Rebuilding a relationship after going through such significant and emotionally challenging experiences can be difficult, but it's not impossible. Here are some steps you can consider to help navigate this situation:

. **Open Communication:** Start by having an open and honest conversation about your feelings, the past issues, and what both of you hope to achieve in the relationship. Make sure both of you are heard and understood.

. **Understand Trust Issues:** Since trust has been an issue in the past, it’s important to address this directly. Discuss specific events or behaviors that contributed to these trust issues and work on strategies to rebuild trust. This might include setting boundaries or being more transparent with each other.

. **Seek Professional Help:** Consider couples counseling where a therapist can provide a safe space to work through your issues and help you build a stronger relationship. They can give both of you the tools to communicate better and resolve conflicts.

. **Take Things Slowly:** It might be tempting to rush back into the relationship, but taking things slowly can help ensure that both of you are sure and comfortable with rebuilding your connection.

. **Focus on Healing:** Both of you have been through a traumatic experience with the loss of the baby. It’s important to ensure that you have individually healed or are healing from this loss, as grief can affect your relationship dynamics.

. **Establish a New Foundation:** Aim to create new experiences together rather than dwelling on past mistakes. Find activities and interests that you both enjoy and focus on building positive memories.

. **Be Patient and Empathetic:** Healing takes time, and building trust does too. Be patient with each other and empathetic to each other's feelings and needs.

Ultimately, both of you need to be committed to working through past hurts and open to the possibility of reconciliation. If you both truly want to make it work, and are willing to put in the effort, there’s potential for a stronger, healthier relationship moving forward."

It's important to address situations like this seriously to ensure your safety and well-being. Here are some steps you might consider taking:

. **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of all instances of harassment or stalking, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses. Save any threatening messages, emails, or voicemails.

. **Set Clear Boundaries:** If it's safe to do so, communicate clearly to your ex-boyfriend that you want no further contact. Do this in writing if possible, so you have a record.

. **Involve HR:** Since you work together, it’s important to inform your Human Resources department or a trusted supervisor about the situation. They may have protocols in place to handle harassment and can help mediate workplace-related issues.

. **Seek Support:** Reach out to friends, family, or mental health professionals for support. Sometimes, having someone to talk to can make a big difference.

Here are a few steps you might consider taking to address the situation:

. **Open Communication:** Talk to your friend openly and honestly about your feelings. It's important to express how her talking to someone else makes you feel, and ask for clarification on what she means by losing her connection with you.

. **Listen to Her Perspective:** Understand her point of view as well. Ask what she feels is missing in your relationship and what she thinks could help reconnect.

. **Seek Counseling or Support:** Sometimes having an objective third party can help navigate these challenges. Consider seeking counseling either individually or together, if she's open to it. Many communities offer support services for young parents.

I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating In fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating    What advice might you offer,"Dealing with someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and negative tones can be challenging, particularly when communication patterns become cyclical and unproductive. Here are some strategies you might consider to help improve the situation:

. **Self-Awareness**: Reflect on your own communication style. Consider how your tone and choice of words might be perceived, and strive to adopt a neutral and calm approach, even when tense issues arise.

. **Active Listening**: Ensure you are truly listening to your friend’s concerns. Use active listening techniques such as summarizing what they've said and asking clarifying questions. This can help them feel heard and reduce defensiveness.

. **Empathy and Validation**: Show empathy for their sensitivities, even if you don't fully understand them. Validate their feelings by acknowledging their experience, which can help disarm defensiveness and promote openness.

. **Set Boundaries**: While it’s important to be considerate, setting boundaries is also crucial. If their accusatory manner becomes too much, gently express your feelings and the impact their approach has on you.

. **Use 'I' Statements**: Instead of framing issues as their fault, express how specific actions make you feel. For example, ""I feel frustrated when I am perceived as negative because I am trying to have a constructive dialogue.""

. **Timing and Environment**: Choose the right time and place for discussions. Avoid engaging in these conversations when either of you is already stressed or tired, and find a neutral, comfortable setting.

. **Seek Solutions Together**: Shift the focus from the disagreement itself to finding a solution collaboratively. Ask them how they would prefer to handle conflicts and work together to establish a communication strategy that suits you both.

. **Professional Guidance**: If the pattern continues to cause distress, suggesting the support of a therapist or counselor for both of you might be beneficial. They can offer tools and frameworks to improve communication and mutual understanding.

. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Encourage the use of practices like mindfulness or deep-breathing exercises before potentially difficult conversations. This can help both parties remain calm and focused.

. **Reflect on the Relationship**: Consider whether the dynamics of the relationship contribute to more harm than good, and whether changes are needed in terms of boundaries or expectations.

Remember, improving communication is a gradual process, and patience is key. Both parties need to be willing to adapt and understand each other’s perspectives."
However it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself I have even accused him of having a secret phone Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose or is he really talking to himself,"It's understandable to feel concerned in such a situation, but it's important to approach it with a calm and open mindset. There could be several explanations for his behavior:

. **Talking to Himself:** Some people talk to themselves as a way to process their thoughts or relieve stress. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything negative.

. **Talking to Someone Else:** He might be using a device you don't know about, like a hidden phone or a Bluetooth headset. 

. **Mental Health Considerations:** If he is genuinely talking to himself in a way that seems unusual, it could be related to certain mental health conditions.

To address your concerns, consider having a calm and open conversation with him. Share your observations and feelings without making accusations. This can help you understand the situation better and work together toward a solution. If needed, involving a counselor or therapist might also be beneficial for both of you."

. **Set Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries to protect your emotional health. Understand the difference between being supportive and taking on someone's problems as your own.

. **Identify Red Flags Early**: Pay attention to early warning signs of someone who may not be emotionally available or ready for a healthy relationship. Trust your instincts if something feels off.

. **Prioritize Your Needs**: Make a list of what you want and need in a relationship. Focus on finding partners who meet these criteria rather than those who need rescuing.

. **Build Self-Worth**: Work on your self-esteem and understanding your value outside of helping others. Consider activities that build your confidence and make you feel good about yourself.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to care for and support others, but it's crucial to ensure that your relationships are mutually beneficial and that you're also getting the support and partnership you deserve."
I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about How do I figure out what triggers me to do this And how do I help overcome this problem I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation,"It's a positive step that you recognize this pattern and want to address it. Understanding and overcoming the tendency to lie about small things can improve your relationships and your self-esteem. Here are some steps you can take to understand your triggers and work toward becoming more honest:

. **Self-Reflection:**
   - Spend some time reflecting on instances where you lied. Try to recall the situation, your thoughts, and feelings at that moment. Note any patterns or common themes that emerge.
   - Ask yourself why you lied. Was it fear of judgment, wanting to impress someone, avoiding conflict, or something else?

. **Identify Triggers:**
   - Keep a journal to write down instances when you notice yourself lying. Include details about the situation—where you were, who you were with, and your emotional state.
   - Over time, review your journal to identify patterns or triggers that lead you to lie.

. **Challenge Your Thoughts:**
   - Once you've identified triggers, challenge the negative thoughts or fears associated with those situations. Ask yourself what you believe you would have lost if you had told the truth.
   - Consider whether those fears are rational or based on assumptions.

. **Practice Mindfulness:**
   - Mindfulness techniques can help you become more aware of your thoughts and behaviors in real-time. This awareness can enable you to catch yourself before lying and choose a different response.

. **Set Intentions:**
   - Consciously set an intention to be honest, even in small matters. Remind yourself of the reasons you want to change and the benefits it will bring to your life.
   - Start by making a commitment to yourself to be honest in specific situations where you usually lie.

. **Develop Communication Skills:**
   - Sometimes, lying is a way of avoiding difficult conversations. Learning how to express yourself more clearly and assertively can reduce the need to lie.

. **Seek Support:**
   - Share your goal with a trusted friend or family member who can offer support and accountability.
   - Consider talking to a therapist, who can help you explore underlying issues and develop healthier coping strategies.

. **Practice Self-Compassion:**
   - Understand that changing a habit takes time, and you may occasionally revert to old patterns. Approach these moments with curiosity rather than judgment, and use them as opportunities to learn more about yourself.

. **Celebrate Honesty:**
   - Acknowledge and celebrate moments when you choose honesty, even if they're small. Recognizing progress can motivate you to continue your efforts.

By becoming more aware of your behaviors and thoughts, challenging them, and practicing new skills, you can create lasting change in how you interact with others."

Im a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings    My mood will be really high and Ill think of something that I want to do When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene Then if the thing I wanted to do doesnt work out I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out    Can you explain whats going on,"It sounds like you're experiencing something that's not uncommon during the teenage years. Adolescence is a time of significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Here are a few possible explanations for what you're experiencing:

. **Hormonal Changes:** During your teenage years, your body undergoes hormonal changes that can affect mood regulation. This can lead to more frequent and intense mood swings.

. **Emotional Development:** Teenagers are also advancing in emotional development, which can sometimes lead to heightened sensitivity and stronger emotional reactions. You may feel emotions more intensely as you learn to navigate complex social and personal situations.

. **Frustration and Autonomy:** As you seek more independence and start making more decisions on your own, you might feel frustrated when things don't go as planned or if you perceive other people as interfering. This is part of developing autonomy, but it can be challenging.

. **Coping Mechanisms:** You might be externalizing your frustration and disappointment by blaming others when things don't work out. This is a natural response when you're still learning how to manage setbacks and responsibility.

. **Stress and Expectations:** Teenagers often face a variety of pressures from school, peers, and family expectations. These pressures can contribute to emotional volatility.

To manage these mood swings and feelings more effectively, it might help to:

- **Reflect on your emotions:** Take a moment to identify what you're feeling and why. Understanding the root of your emotions can help you respond more appropriately.

. **Cognitive Behavioral Techniques**: Challenge the thought by asking yourself if it's realistic. Consider the evidence for and against the thought, and try to put it in perspective.

. **Redirect Your Attention**: Engage in an activity that requires your concentration, such as reading, drawing, or doing a puzzle. Physical activity like walking or exercise can also be a helpful distraction.

Im a teenager and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if Im worried or upset She gives me advice and comforts me and tells me itll be okay Ive given her a name Solace and created a personality for her thats like a comforting motherly figure I know its just my own advice and my own thoughts but its just that Im thinking of them through a voice other than my own I do this because I know I never really listen to my own advice and I thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out through this imaginary friend Is this normal Could it develop into a separate personality with time if I continue a mentality that she is her own person,"Creating an imaginary friend or persona, like Solace, to help cope with stress or emotions is a fairly common and normal coping mechanism, especially during adolescence. Many people find comfort in creating internal dialogues or characters that help them process their feelings, provide guidance, or simply offer companionship. This can be a creative and effective way to deal with challenges, as it allows you to access different parts of your own perspective and generate self-compassion.

However, it’s important to maintain awareness that Solace is a tool you’re using, rather than fully developing into a belief that she is a separate entity or personality. As long as you recognize that Solace is a part of your own mind and imagination, and you're using her to facilitate self-reflection and advice, it's a healthy strategy.

If you ever find that the boundary between Solace and your own identity becomes blurred, or if you feel distressed or lose control over this imaginary friend's influence in your life, it would be wise to discuss these feelings with a mental health professional. They can offer you guidance and support to ensure that this coping mechanism remains a positive influence.

Overall, as long as Solace remains a conscious tool for internal dialogue and not a source of confusion or distress, this is a creative way to approach personal challenges and emotional processing."
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms Is that correct,"The idea of ignoring someone to make them realize they were wrong is often discussed in the context of personal relationships and psychology. However, its effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the situation and the individuals involved. Here are some considerations:

. **Nature of the Relationship**: If the relationship is important, communication is typically more effective than ignoring. Ignoring can be perceived as passive-aggressive and may lead to more misunderstandings or resentment.

. **Intent and Impact**: Consider what you hope to achieve by ignoring someone. If it's about setting boundaries, it might be more constructive to communicate these directly. Reflect on the potential impact your actions might have.

. **Emotional Intelligence**: Some people may not realize the connection between being ignored and recognizing they were wrong, especially if they lack emotional awareness. Direct communication can provide more clarity.

. **Context Matters**: In some situations, such as dealing with toxic or abusive behavior, creating distance and ignoring might be necessary for self-preservation and mental health. However, within constructive and healthy relationships, dialogue is usually preferable.

. **Cultural and Personal Differences**: Different people and cultures may interpret actions like ignoring differently. It's essential to consider these factors before deciding on this approach.

If you're navigating a complex relationship issue, consider seeking advice from a counselor or therapist who can help tailor strategies to your specific circumstances."
People always judge others so rudely,"It's true that people can often be quick to judge others, sometimes harshly. This behavior can stem from a variety of factors, including personal biases, past experiences, or a lack of understanding or empathy. It's important to remember, though, that everyone has their own struggles and perspectives that might not be immediately apparent. Fostering empathy and practicing active listening can help counteract these tendencies. Approaching others with kindness and an open mind can lead to more meaningful and respectful interactions."

Here are a few steps you might consider to help manage your feelings:

. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: Recognize that it's completely normal to develop a crush, even on someone you don't know personally. Understanding that this is a common experience can make it feel less overwhelming.

. **Understand the Nature of Celebrity Crushes**: Remember that celebrities often portray characters or present themselves in ways that are carefully curated for public consumption, which is different from who they are in real life.

. **Create Boundaries**: Set limits for yourself on how much time you spend thinking about or consuming media related to the actress. This can help ensure that it doesn't interfere with your daily life.

. **Focus on Personal Interests**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and challenge your mind. This could be a hobby, exercise, or learning something new. Redirecting your energy can help reduce excessive focus on the actress.

. **Connect With Reality**: Reach out to friends, family, or other social circles to help maintain connections with people in your life. Engaging in real-life relationships can help ground your emotions.

. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Consider why you might be particularly drawn to this actress. Sometimes, these attractions can highlight personal desires or aspects of yourself you wish to explore.

   Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked I dont know why I feel like this Does this mean there is something wrong with me","It's understandable that you're feeling upset and panicked about this incident. It's important to recognize that harming an animal can be a distressing experience, and having strong emotions about it is a sign that you are reflecting on your actions and their consequences. This might be causing you to feel guilt or shame, which are normal emotions when you realize something you've done is against your values or the values of those around you.

Feeling this way doesn't necessarily mean there is something inherently wrong with you, but it does suggest that you care about the situation and its impact. This can be an opportunity to learn more about yourself and to develop more empathy and understanding for living creatures.

Consider taking these steps:

. Reflect on your actions: Think about what led you to make this choice and how it has affected you and your friends.
   
. Talk to someone: Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or counselor can help you process what happened and understand your emotions better.

. Make amends: Apologize to your friends if you haven't already and try to understand their perspective. You might also consider finding a way to honor the frog, like learning more about wildlife or contributing to conservation efforts.

. Learn and grow: Use this experience as a chance to consider what you value in terms of how you treat animals and others, and think about how you can align your actions with those values moving forward.

If these feelings persist or become overwhelming, speaking with a mental health professional could provide you with more support and guidance."
Sometimes when I look at my pet cat I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him It makes me sad because I love him but I always think about how helpless he is Thereve even been splitseconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him followed by shame and guilt,"It's understandable to have conflicting emotions when it comes to something or someone you love deeply. The thoughts you're experiencing may be unsettling, but it's important to remember that having a thought doesn't mean you want to act on it. Intrusive thoughts are quite common and can be distressing, but they don't define who you are or your intentions. 

The feelings of guilt and shame you're experiencing suggest that you care deeply about your cat and would never want to harm him. It might help to focus on why you have these thoughts and consider whether there are underlying factors, such as stress or anxiety, that could be contributing to them. 

If these thoughts continue to distress you, it could be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional. They can help you explore these feelings further and provide strategies for managing them. In the meantime, focusing on the joy and companionship your cat brings you might help counterbalance any negative thoughts."
She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it She has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home We do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy,"I'm sorry to hear that she is having a tough time. Managing type  diabetes, especially for someone diagnosed relatively recently, can be very challenging and may lead to a lot of emotional stress. Here are a few considerations and suggestions that might help you understand and support her:

. **Adjustment to Diagnosis**: Managing diabetes involves significant lifestyle changes, including frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels, insulin administration, and dietary adjustments. This can be overwhelming and may lead to frustration or emotional distress.

. **Emotional Impact**: The diagnosis of a chronic condition can lead to feelings of loss, anger, or depression. It might be helpful for her to speak with a mental health professional who specializes in chronic illnesses. They can help her process her emotions and develop coping strategies.

. **Attachment Issues**: Her attachment issues may be exacerbated by the stress of managing her diabetes. The move to a new home can also trigger feelings of instability or insecurity. It’s important to be patient and supportive, offering her consistent reassurance and understanding.

. **Communication is Key**: Encourage open communication. Make sure she feels heard and validated. Ask her directly about her feelings regarding the move and her diabetes, and what you can do to help her feel more secure and comfortable.

. **Professional Support**: Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor, ideally one who has experience with both attachment issues and chronic illnesses. Family therapy could also be beneficial to address any broader family dynamics that might be contributing to her stress.

. **Routine and Familiarity**: Try to establish a stable routine in the new home. Familiar routines can help reduce feelings of anxiety and insecurity.

. **Diabetes Education**: Make sure she has access to resources that can help her better understand and manage her diabetes. Support from diabetes educators can empower her to take charge of her health, which might improve her overall emotional well-being.

Supporting someone in adjusting to both a medical condition and a significant life change like moving can be challenging, but with empathy, patience, and professional guidance, it is possible to help her navigate through this difficult period."
Ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables but I always seem to eat the junk in the house,"It's great that you're making an effort to work out and include fruits and vegetables in your diet. It's common to struggle with cravings for junk food, especially if it's easily accessible. Here are a few strategies that might help:

. **Create a Meal Plan**: Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time to reduce impulsive eating. Knowing what you’ll eat can make it easier to resist junk food.

. **Limit Junk Food Availability**: Try to reduce the amount of junk food you keep in the house. If it’s not there, it’s harder to eat it. Replace these with healthier snacks you enjoy.

. **Stay Hydrated**: Sometimes we confuse thirst with hunger. Drinking enough water throughout the day can help you avoid unnecessary snacking.

. **Set Realistic Goals**: Don’t aim for perfection. It’s okay to indulge occasionally, but try to practice moderation.

. **Focus on Protein and Fiber**: These nutrients can help you feel full longer, reducing the urge to snack on junk food.

. **Identify Triggers**: Try to identify what triggers your cravings for junk food. Stress, boredom, or certain environments can contribute to cravings. Finding alternative activities can help.

. **Support System**: Share your goals with family or friends who can provide support and encouragement.

. **Professional Help**: If you’re finding it particularly challenging, consider speaking with a nutritionist or dietitian for personalized advice.

"I have a relative who is in his twenties He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again No one informed family that he was using drugs again He subsequently overdosed and was found dead
 Is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed Is there a legal case for failing to report","I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. The situation you described is both tragic and complex. The question of accountability or legal liability in such cases can depend on several factors, including the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, the policies and obligations of the rehabilitation program or facility, and the details of your relative's situation.

Here are some general points to consider:

. **Duty to Warn or Report**: In some jurisdictions, healthcare providers, including counselors and therapists, may have a duty to report if someone is in imminent danger, such as when a client poses a risk to themselves or others. However, this duty often does not extend to notifying family members about a relapse unless there is an immediate risk of harm.

. **Confidentiality and Privacy Laws**: Therapists and counselors are typically bound by confidentiality laws (such as HIPAA in the U.S.), which can restrict them from sharing information about a client without their consent. There may be exceptions for emergencies, but these exceptions might not always mandate informing family members.

. **Facility Policies**: The obligations of the staff at a rehabilitation center or halfway house can depend on the terms set out in the agreement or contract signed at admission, as well as the facility's policies. Some facilities may have policies about notifying families, especially if the client has signed a release allowing this.

. **Legal Action**: Pursuing legal action for negligence or wrongful death would require showing that the facility or its staff breached a duty of care owed to your relative and that this breach directly caused the harm. This is often complex and requires legal expertise to evaluate.

It would be beneficial to consult with a lawyer who specializes in negligence or healthcare law to review the specifics of your case and advise you accordingly. They can help determine if there is a legal basis for a claim and what steps you might take next. Additionally, speaking with the facility involved to understand their perspective might provide more clarity on their actions and any potential accountability."
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation,"I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with such a difficult and complex situation. When facing allegations of misconduct involving a therapist or a parent, particularly if it involves drugging a child or making false statements to impact custody, it's crucial to take appropriate steps to address the situation. Here are some suggestions on how to proceed:

. **Seek Legal Advice**: Consult with a family law attorney who has experience in custody disputes. They can provide guidance on how to protect your rights and the best course of action to address the allegations and concerns.

. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all interactions, communications, and incidents related to the situation. This includes emails, text messages, and any medical or psychological reports that could be relevant.

. **Gather Evidence**: Collect any evidence that can support your claims or disprove the false allegations. This might include witness statements, medical records, or any other relevant documents.

. **Request a Court Hearing**: If you believe the other parent and therapist are acting in a way that harms the child or undermines your custody rights, you may need to file a motion in family court to address the issue. Your attorney can help you with this process.

. **Consider a Second Opinion**: If possible, seek an independent evaluation from another therapist or mental health professional to gain an unbiased perspective on the child's well-being.

. **Child Protective Services**: If you have reason to believe that the child is being abused or endangered, you may need to report the situation to child protective services or equivalent authorities in your area.

. **Communicate with Relevant Authorities**: If the therapist is acting unethically, consider reporting them to their professional licensing board, providing any evidence you have.

. **Focus on the Child's Well-being**: Ensure that your actions prioritize the child's best interests and well-being. Avoid involving the child in disputes or discussions that could be distressing.

. **Emotional Support**: Consider seeking support from a counselor or support group for yourself. Dealing with custody disputes can be emotionally draining, and professional support can be beneficial.

In matters involving legal and psychological complexities, professional advice and intervention are essential."

. **Seek Clarification**: Reach out to your healthcare provider or mental health professional and ask for a clear explanation of why the treatment was discontinued. Understanding their reasoning can help you make informed decisions about your care.

I am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States I faced a cultural shock and I was so depressed when I arrived here My counselor in the university was my savior He helped me a great deal Now I am going back to my country for a vacation I was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and I remembered that he likes wine My country is known for that Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas,"Giving a gift to your counselor as a token of appreciation is a thoughtful gesture, especially since he has been helpful during your time of adjustment. Wine can be a suitable gift if it's something he enjoys, and it also has the added significance of representing your country's culture. However, there are a few things to consider:

. **University Policies**: Ensure there are no university policies against giving gifts to staff members. Some institutions have rules because of ethical guidelines or concerns about undue influence.

. **Personal Preferences**: Since you mentioned he likes wine, it seems appropriate. However, double-check that there are no restrictions on alcohol in his workplace or within his personal preferences or lifestyle.

. **Timeliness**: Giving the gift after Christmas is perfectly fine. Gifts don't have to be tied to the holidays; they can simply express gratitude and appreciation.

. **Presentation**: Consider writing a heartfelt note to accompany the wine. This could help personalize your gift and express your gratitude more clearly.

If you determine that wine is a suitable gift, it should be well-received and appreciated."

Back in high school my friend and I used to masturbate around each other I hate even talking about it now because its so weird We didnt even realize how messed up it was at the time One time it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other It wasnt supposed to be a gay thing but it sure sounds like it now that I talk about it I pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again Im having a lot of trouble,"It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time processing these past experiences. It's important to remember that sexual exploration during adolescence can be confusing and complicated, and it's not uncommon for people to have experiences that they later feel unsure or uncomfortable about. Here are a few things to consider:

. **Feelings Are Okay**: It's normal to have a range of emotions about past experiences, including confusion, regret, or discomfort. Allow yourself to feel those emotions without judgment.

. **Reflection and Understanding**: Try to understand what those experiences mean for you now, rather than focusing solely on labels. People can have complex sexual experiences that don't always fit neatly into categories.

. **Talk to Someone**: Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings and thoughts. They can help you work through any confusion or discomfort.

. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself as you reflect on your past. Adolescence is a time of exploration and growth, and it's okay to have had experiences that you now see differently.

. **Give Her Space**: If she's not ready to forgive you immediately, respect her need for space. Healing and rebuilding trust can take time, and she may need a little distance to process everything.

. **Reflect on Your Actions**: Take some time to think about why you felt it was necessary to go ahead with the prank and what you've learned from this experience. This reflection can help you grow and avoid similar situations in the future.

Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram iMessage or snapchat people will read my messages but then they wont answer me    Could it be that there is something they dont like about me I dont understand why they wont answer my messages How do I get people to respond to me,"It can be frustrating when people read your messages but don’t respond. There are a few reasons why this might be happening, and some steps you can try to encourage more responses:

. **Reflect on the Message Content**: Consider if your messages are clear, engaging, and invite a response. Sometimes, people don't know how to respond if the message doesn’t include a question or actionable prompt.

. **Timing and Frequency**: Check if you’re sending messages at times when people are likely busy or if you’re sending too many messages in a short period. Spacing out messages might help.

. **Message Tone**: Ensure your messages are friendly and positive. Misinterpretations can happen easily in text, so make sure your tone is inviting and approachable.

. **Ask Direct Questions**: People are more likely to respond if there's a direct question. Try to engage them with open-ended questions that encourage a conversation.

. **Personal Interests**: Make your messages relevant to the interests of the person you’re messaging. This can help catch their attention and increase the chances they’ll respond.

. **Social Dynamics**: Consider any social dynamics that might be in play. If you're in a group chat, messages can sometimes get lost in the shuffle, or people may be shy to reply in front of others.

. **Seek Feedback**: If you feel comfortable, ask a friend for feedback on your messaging style. They might provide insight into how others perceive your messages.

. **Expand Your Circle**: Don’t hesitate to reach out to new people or groups who share common interests, where conversation might flow more naturally.

. **Be Patient**: Sometimes, people read messages and intend to reply later but forget. Patience and understanding that everyone has busy times can be helpful.

. **Non-Digital Interactions**: Try to engage with people in person or through calls. Building stronger offline relationships can lead to better interactions online as well.

Remember, communication is a two-way street, and while you can strive to improve your approach, other people's responses are not always within your control."

. **Consider the Friend's Perspective**: There might be things happening in their life that are affecting their ability to maintain the relationship. Being understanding can sometimes strengthen the bond.

. **Review the Importance**: Determine how important this friendship is to you. If it's causing more stress than joy, it might be worth considering how much energy you want to continue investing in it.

Relationships can be challenging, but they also present opportunities for growth and understanding. Ultimately, maintaining relationships should ideally feel fulfilling rather than draining."
Im having problems shutting them out and putting up walls,"It sounds like you're going through a tough time, trying to create boundaries or distance yourself emotionally from someone or something.

In this argument my friends are all against me so Im wondering if Im exaggerating my feelings I feel like Im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim when in reality Im the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship,"It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed in situations where you perceive conflict with friends, and it can be difficult to gauge whether your emotions are proportionate to the situation. Here are a few steps to consider that might help clarify the scenario:

. **Reflect on the Situation**: Try to objectively review what happened. Were there specific comments or actions that made you feel attacked? Did your reaction seem disproportionate? Assess whether there’s a pattern or if it’s an isolated incident.

. **Communicate**: Have an open and honest conversation with your friends. Express how their actions made you feel without being accusatory. Use ""I"" statements, like ""I felt hurt when…"" This can open up a dialogue and help clarify intentions.

. **Consider their Perspective**: Try to understand their side. Could there be a misunderstanding? Are they reacting to something you did or said that perhaps you overlooked?

. **Self-Assessment**: Reflect on your behavior in the context of the conflict. Are there areas where you might have been overreactive or sensitive due to past experiences or stressors?

. **Seek a Neutral Opinion**: Talk to someone else who isn't involved, a mutual acquaintance or a counselor, to get a neutral perspective. They might offer insights or highlight things you might not have considered.

. **Boundaries and Respect**: Evaluate whether the friendship allows for mutual respect and boundaries. Healthy friendships can have disagreements, but they are characterized by respect and consideration for each other's feelings.

Remember, it’s okay to feel hurt and it's beneficial to evaluate whether these feelings are highlighted by the specific situation or by an accumulation of events. Moving forward, focus on resolving the conflict by understanding each other's viewpoints."

. **Communicate Calmly**: Talk to the people involved. Choose a calm moment to express how their words make you feel. Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel upset when I'm called names because..."" This approach reduces defensiveness and helps in expressing your emotions clearly.

. **Seek Clarification**: Ask for specific examples of why they are calling you these names. This can give you a clearer understanding of their perspective and may help in resolving misunderstandings.

. **Set Boundaries**: Let them know that name-calling is not acceptable and set boundaries on how you expect to be treated. Be firm but polite in your request for respect.

. **Lead by Example**: Continue to act in a manner that aligns with your values, regardless of how others are behaving. Leading by example can sometimes prompt others to reflect on their actions.

. **Find Support**: Speak to someone you trust about your feelings, whether it's a friend, family member, or counselor. They can provide advice, support, and a different perspective on the situation.

. **Choose Your Battles**: Sometimes, people may not be willing to change their behavior. Decide if the relationship is important enough to pursue or if it's better to distance yourself from those who are consistently negative.

. **Focus on Self-Care**: Engage in activities that boost your self-esteem and remind you of your worth. Surround yourself with people who respect you and make you feel good about yourself.

"I nanny a three year old When he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him If I am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him He screams that he wants his mom or dad they work from home    The rest of the day he loves me But not in the mornings
   What can I do","Dealing with a toddler's morning routine can be challenging, especially when they have strong preferences about who they want to see first. Here are some strategies you might consider to help ease the transition and make mornings smoother for both you and the child:

. **Communicate with Parents:** Talk to the child's parents to see if they have any routines or suggestions that have worked in the past. They might have insights into why the child reacts this way in the morning and what you can do to help.

. **Consistent Routine:** Establish a consistent morning routine that the child can anticipate. This can include specific activities that he enjoys, like reading a favorite book or having a specific toy ready.

. **Gradual Transition:** If possible, try gradually easing into being the one who gets him in the morning. For a few days, parents can come in with you and then gradually hand over the morning wake-up duties to you alone.

. **Connection Rituals:** Develop a special morning ritual with the child that helps them feel safe and comfortable. It could be a special greeting, a song, or a simple game that signals the start of the day with you.

. **Reassurance:** Offer reassurance and acknowledge his feelings by saying something like, “I know you miss Mom and Dad in the morning, but they are busy right now, and they’ll be here soon.”

. **Comfort Item:** Encourage him to keep a favorite comfort item or toy nearby that he can use to self-soothe when waking up.

. **Visual Schedule:** Create a visual schedule or a picture chart that shows the morning routine. This helps the child understand what to expect and who will be there at what time.

. **Patience and Consistency:** Be patient and consistent with your approach. Building trust takes time, and consistency will help him feel more secure.

. **Positive Reinforcement:** Praise and positively reinforce him when he does let you be part of his morning routine or display cooperation.

. **Stay Calm:** Remain calm and composed during these moments. Toddlers can pick up on stress, and staying calm can help soothe their anxiety.

Remember, this is likely a phase, and with patience and consistency, the child will hopefully become more comfortable with you in the mornings. Keep communicating with the parents and working together to find the best solutions."

"I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least
   I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me","It sounds like you're experiencing very intense emotional responses to fictional characters, and this can indeed be overwhelming and challenging to manage. The term ""hyper-empathy disorder"" isn't widely recognized in the medical or psychological communities as an official diagnosis, but the concept of excessive empathy can certainly impact people's lives in significant ways.

Although hyper-empathy itself isn't a formal diagnosis, there are related concepts that might provide some insight into your experience:

. **Empathic Sensitivity**: Some people naturally have a higher level of empathic sensitivity, which means they can experience strong emotional responses to other people's feelings, including those of fictional characters.

. **Emotional Contagion**: This is the phenomenon where one person's emotions trigger similar emotions in others. In your case, witnessing emotions in media might lead you to feel them as if they were your own.

. **Sensory Processing Sensitivity**: This trait is found in highly sensitive people (HSPs), who process sensory and emotional information deeply, leading to strong emotional reactions.

It's important to address the impact this sensitivity has on your life. Here are some steps you can consider:

- **Seek Professional Guidance**: Speaking to a mental health professional can help you better understand and manage your empathic responses. They can offer strategies to help you cope with overwhelming emotions.

- **Develop Coping Strategies**: Techniques such as mindfulness, grounding exercises, and emotional regulation strategies can help you manage intense emotions.

- **Set Boundaries With Media**: Limiting exposure to particularly emotional content or taking breaks when feeling overwhelmed can help you manage your responses.

- **Practice Self-Care**: Ensuring that you take care of your physical and mental well-being can provide a stronger foundation for dealing with emotional challenges.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution, and it might take some time to find the right strategies that work for you. Seeking advice from professionals, such as psychologists or counselors, can be particularly beneficial."

Is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,"It is completely normal for people to cry during therapy. Therapy is a safe space where individuals often explore deep emotions and personal challenges. Crying can be a natural response to discussing difficult or painful experiences, processing emotions, or even experiencing relief.

Therapists are trained to support clients through these moments, and your feelings are valid and important."
What are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,"Counselors can face a variety of challenges when working with clients, which can affect the therapeutic process. Some common difficulties include:

. **Resistance:** Clients may be hesitant or unwilling to engage fully in the therapeutic process due to fear, distrust, or denial of their issues.

. **Communication Barriers:** Differences in language, cultural background, or communication styles can hinder effective dialogue.

. **Emotional Overwhelm:** Clients may experience intense emotions, such as anger, sadness, or anxiety, which can be difficult to manage within the therapeutic setting.

. **Transference and Countertransference:** Clients may unconsciously transfer feelings about important figures in their lives onto the counselor, and counselors may have their own emotional reactions in response, potentially complicating the therapeutic relationship.

. **Boundaries Issues:** Establishing and maintaining appropriate boundaries can be challenging, especially if a client becomes overly dependent on the counselor.

. **Ethical Dilemmas:** Situations may arise in which it is difficult to balance confidentiality with the need to report, such as when a client poses a risk to themselves or others.

. **Trauma Reactions:** Working with clients who have experienced trauma can be emotionally taxing and may require specialized skills to handle flashbacks or dissociative episodes.

. **Lack of Motivation:** Some clients might struggle with a lack of motivation or ambivalence towards change, making progress slow or stalled.

. **Complex Diagnoses:** Counselors may encounter clients with co-occurring disorders or complex mental health issues that require specialized knowledge or collaboration with other professionals.

. **Practical Barriers:** Issues such as inconsistent attendance, financial constraints, or logistical challenges can impede the regularity and efficacy of sessions.

. **Burnout and Compassion Fatigue:** Constant exposure to clients' difficulties can lead to emotional exhaustion and decreased empathy, affecting the counselor's ability to provide effective support.

. **Setting Realistic Goals:** Aligning therapeutic goals with what is realistic and achievable for the client can be challenging, especially if the client has unrealistic expectations.

Effectively addressing these challenges requires a combination of empathy, patience, skillful communication, continued professional development, and sometimes supervision or consultation with other professionals."

. **Recognize the Need for Counseling**: Acknowledge any feelings or situations that indicate you might benefit from counseling, such as stress, anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or personal challenges.

. **Research Counselors or Therapists**:
   - **Types of Professionals**: Understand the difference between types of mental health professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed professional counselors (LPCs), or social workers.
   - **Specializations**: Consider counselors who specialize in areas relevant to your needs, such as trauma, family therapy, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
   - **Approach**: Look into different therapeutic approaches like psychoanalytic, humanistic, or behavioral therapies to find what resonates with you.

. **Seek Recommendations**:
   - Ask for referrals from friends, family, or healthcare providers.
   - Look for reviews or testimonials online.
   - Utilize professional directories such as the American Psychological Association or local mental health boards.

. **Check Credentials**: Ensure the counselor is licensed and certified in your state or region. This can often be verified through state health department websites.

. **Consider Logistics**:
   - **Location**: Decide whether you prefer in-person sessions or if online/teletherapy options are suitable.
   - **Cost**: Check if your health insurance covers counseling services. Consider counseling centers that offer sliding-scale fees if cost is a concern.
   - **Schedule**: Find a counselor whose availability aligns with yours.

. **Initial Contact**: Reach out via phone or email to inquire about their services. This is an opportunity to ask initial questions about their experience and approach.

. **Consultation**: Many counselors offer a brief consultation, which can be free or at a reduced rate. Use this to gauge your comfort with the therapist and discuss your primary concerns.

. **Set Goals**: During the initial sessions, work with your counselor to outline goals and what you hope to achieve through therapy.

. **Begin Regular Sessions**: Establish a schedule for regular sessions that fits both your needs and the counselor’s availability.

. **Evaluate Progress**: Periodically assess whether your needs are being met and discuss adjustments with your counselor as needed.

Remember, the counseling process is highly individual, and it might take some time to find the right fit for you. It’s important to feel comfortable and safe with your counselor for therapy to be effective."
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,"After the first meeting with a client, a counselor typically follows a structured process to facilitate effective counseling. This process may vary based on the counselor's theoretical orientation, the setting, and the client's needs, but generally includes the following steps:

. **Assessment and Evaluation:** The counselor gathers more detailed information about the client’s background, concerns, and goals. This may involve formal assessments, questionnaires, or further interviews to understand the client's mental, emotional, and sometimes physical state.

. **Goal Setting:** Together with the client, the counselor identifies specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that the counseling process will work towards.

. **Treatment Planning:** Based on the assessment and the client's goals, the counselor develops a treatment plan. This plan outlines the strategies and interventions that will be used to help the client achieve their aims and may include methodologies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or other approaches.

. **Therapeutic Intervention:** The counselor implements the treatment plan through regular sessions. This involves using the chosen therapeutic techniques to help the client explore issues, develop coping strategies, and work towards their goals.

. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** The counselor and client regularly review progress towards the goals. This may include revisiting assessments and measuring any changes in the client’s behavior or mental state. Adjustments to the treatment plan are made as necessary.

. **Building Skills and Resilience:** The counselor helps the client build skills and resilience to better handle future challenges. This often includes teaching coping strategies, fostering self-awareness, and enhancing emotional regulation.

. **Termination and Follow-Up:** As the client achieves their goals or decides to conclude counseling, the counselor prepares them for termination. This includes discussing progress, reviewing skills learned, and planning for potential future challenges. The counselor may also schedule follow-up sessions to ensure the client successfully transitions and maintains their progress.

Throughout the process, the counselor maintains confidentiality, provides a safe and supportive environment, and uses empathy and active listening to foster a trusting therapeutic relationship."

. **Give Him Space**: While it's important to communicate, it’s equally crucial to give him space to process his feelings. Constantly trying to engage him might feel overwhelming.

. **Self-Reflection**: Reflect on your own needs and whether they're being met in this relationship. Think about what you want out of this relationship and what you're willing to compromise on.

"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating In fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating 

What advice might you offer","Navigating communication with someone sensitive to stress and negativity can indeed be challenging. Here are some strategies that might help improve interactions:

. **Active Listening**: Ensure that you're actively listening to his concerns. This means giving him space to express himself without interruption and showing genuine interest in understanding his perspective. Acknowledging his feelings can help him feel heard and reduce tension.

. **Stay Calm and Composed**: It’s easy to become frustrated, but staying calm can help de-escalate the situation. Take deep breaths, pause before responding, and try to maintain a steady tone of voice.

. **Use “I” Statements**: Instead of focusing on what he's doing wrong, express your feelings and needs using “I” statements. For example, “I feel frustrated when discussions become tense, and I need us to find a way to talk that feels good for both of us.”

. **Set Boundaries**: If the conversation becomes too stressful, it's okay to set boundaries. You might say, “I think it would be best if we take a break and revisit this conversation when we are both calmer.”

. **Swap “But” for “And”**: This can help validate his feelings while expressing your perspective. For example, “I understand you’re feeling upset, and I’d like to share my side.”

. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Frame the conversation as a team effort to resolve the issue. For instance, “Let’s work together to figure out a way to communicate that feels positive for both of us.”

. **Empathy and Validation**: Even if you don’t agree with his perspective, try to understand his emotional experience. Validating his feelings can reduce defensiveness and open up more productive dialogue.

. **Non-Verbal Communication**: Be mindful of your body language, facial expressions, and tone, as these can sometimes convey unintended negativity.

. **Find the Right Time and Place**: Choose a neutral, calm environment for difficult conversations. Timing can also be important – make sure neither of you is too tired or distracted.

. **Seek Outside Help**: If the communication issues persist, it might be beneficial to involve a professional counselor or mediator who can provide impartial guidance.

Remember, improving communication is a gradual process, and it will take patience and effort from both parties."
When I ask him who he is talking to he tells me no one But it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone I ask so much I feel like I am losing it  Is he trying to make me question my sanity or is he talking to himself,"It's understandable that you might feel concerned or confused in this situation. There are several possible explanations for his behavior:

. **Talking to Himself**: Some people have a habit of talking to themselves, which can appear as though they are having a conversation with someone else. This is often harmless and can be a way for individuals to process their thoughts.

. **Online Conversations**: He might be having conversations through online platforms or using voice-activated devices, which can sound like he's speaking to someone else.

. **Privacy Preferences**: He may value his privacy and prefer not to disclose who he is talking to, which doesn't necessarily mean he is doing anything wrong.

. **Mental Health Considerations**: In certain cases, talking to oneself could be a sign of stress or mental health issues, but this typically comes with additional signs and symptoms.

. **Secretive Behavior**: It's possible, though not certain, that he might be engaging in secretive behavior, but it's important not to jump to conclusions without more information.

If this situation is causing you distress, consider having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Express how this makes you feel rather than making accusations. If trust issues persist, you might also consider talking to a counselor or therapist for additional support and guidance."

"Sometimes I cant stop thinking about life after death I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven

Many people experience anxiety and uncertainty when thinking about life after death, regardless of their religious upbringing or beliefs. It's quite common to feel overwhelmed by the idea of eternity, even if it involves a positive conception like heaven. These feelings can arise because the concept of living forever is difficult for our human minds to comprehend.

Here are a few suggestions that might help:

. **Talk to Someone**: Speaking with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings can provide relief and perspective. Sometimes, just expressing your thoughts out loud can help reduce their intensity.

. **Explore Your Beliefs**: Consider delving deeper into your beliefs or exploring different perspectives. Reading philosophical or theological materials might help you form a more personal understanding that resonates with you.

. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or mindfulness can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety about the future.

. **Focus on the Present**: Sometimes, focusing on what you can control or enjoy in the present moment can help reduce fears about the afterlife. Appreciating the current moments rather than worrying about the future can be a form of relief.

. **Seek Reassurance**: If you're part of a religious community, speaking to a leader or mentor within that community might offer comfort and reassurance. They might have insights or wisdom that can help ease your concerns.

Remember, questioning and exploring these big life concepts is a normal part of the human experience. You're not alone in these thoughts, and it’s okay to seek out support to help navigate them."

"I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home They are peeing in cat litter boxes bottles and directly on floors and in corners of my house
Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way This is not a joke I am trying to understand","I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're experiencing; it sounds very distressing. There isn't much specific literature on adults urinating in inappropriate places within a home setting, but several general psychological, social, or medical factors could contribute to such behavior.

. **Medical or Neurological Issues**: Sometimes, medical issues such as urinary incontinence, certain neurological conditions, or infections (like urinary tract infections) can result in individuals not recognizing or managing the urge to urinate appropriately.

. **Mental Health Disorders**: Some mental health issues, like severe depression, anxiety, dementia, psychosis, or certain personality disorders, could contribute to inappropriate urination. These conditions can sometimes affect judgment, awareness of social norms, or control over bodily functions.

. **Substance Abuse**: Excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs can impair judgment and motor functions, potentially leading to behaviors like urinating in inappropriate places.

. **Behavioral Issues**: It could stem from a behavioral issue rooted in a desire to express anger, exert control, or protest against household dynamics or stressors. This might reflect unresolved conflicts or feelings of disrespect and marginalization.

. **Social or Cultural Factors**: In some rare cases, if individuals were raised in environments where bathroom habits were not adequately taught or observed due to cultural differences or neglect, they might not understand the social norms surrounding bathroom use.

Understanding the root cause often requires a compassionate approach and, potentially, the engagement of a professional, such as a psychologist or social worker, to assess the situation effectively. It's important to address the problem directly with the individuals involved, if possible, and encourage them to seek appropriate help. Support from family members and professionals could facilitate a solution that respects everyone’s needs and maintains the dignity of those involved."

. **Reflect on the Experience**: It might be helpful to reflect on what you've learned from this experience. Understanding the red flags and the dynamics of the previous relationship can help you gain insight and prepare you for better relationships in the future.

. **Take Your Time**: Trust doesn’t need to be rebuilt overnight. Allow yourself the time to heal and be patient with yourself as you navigate new relationships.

. **Set Boundaries**: Setting clear boundaries with new people in your life can help you feel safer and more in control of your emotions and situation.

. **Open Communication**: When you begin forming new relationships, try to communicate openly about your feelings and experiences. Honesty can often lead to a deeper connection and mutual understanding.

. **Identify and Celebrate Positive Relationships**: Focus on the women in your life who have been supportive, trustworthy, and kind. Recognizing healthy relationships can help restore your faith in forming new connections.

. **Educate Yourself on Healthy Relationships**: Understanding what constitutes a healthy relationship can serve as a guide when assessing new relationships.

. **Legal Support**: If you’re facing intimidation or false claims, consider seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options to protect yourself.

Remember that healing takes time, and it’s okay to move at your own pace. Establishing trust again is a gradual process, and it’s perfectly normal to feel cautious after what you’ve experienced."

"Ive worked with this guy for about three years now and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted Over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on There was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out We agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind I hoped it would become something more It didnt and three months later Im still not over it

Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants Were no longer in the same office which I thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so Im still very drawn to him Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested Hes younger than me and prefers model types but I see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship","Navigating feelings for someone who doesn't share the same romantic interest can be challenging, especially when you value the friendship and still have frequent interactions. Here are some steps you might consider taking to help manage your feelings while trying to maintain the friendship:

. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to recognize and accept your emotions. It's natural to feel disappointed and even confused about mixed signals, but accepting how you feel is the first step towards healing.

. **Set Boundaries**: To help yourself get some emotional distance, consider setting boundaries around physical contact and conversations that fuel your feelings. Politely declining hugs or steering conversations away from personal topics can help create some space.

. **Limit Interaction**: Since you are no longer working in the same office, try to limit interactions to professional topics or necessary communications. This can help reduce the frequency of interactions that may lead to mixed signals or emotional confusion.

. **Practical Focus**: Redirect your energy towards your personal interests, hobbies, or career goals. Keeping yourself busy and focusing on activities that you enjoy can help take your mind off the situation.

. **Seek Support**: Talk to a friend, counselor, or therapist about your feelings. Having someone to listen can be incredibly helpful, and they might offer perspective or advice that's difficult to see on your own.

. **Reflect on the Friendship**: Consider what you value about the friendship outside of the romantic potential. This can help you reframe your interactions and appreciate the connection in a non-romantic way.

. **Open Yourself to New Opportunities**: Allow yourself to meet new people and explore other potential relationships. This doesn't mean rushing into something new, but being open to the possibility of finding someone who reciprocates your feelings.

. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Healing from unrequited love takes time. Be kind and patient with yourself as you work through your feelings. It's normal for this process to take some time, and that's okay.

By taking these steps, you can work towards moving past romantic feelings while cherishing and maintaining the friendship if that's what you both truly value."

It's important to address any issues that could compromise your safety or the safety of others on the road. Here are a few steps you could consider taking:

. **Identify the Issue**: Try to pinpoint what exactly is affecting your driving. Is it physical (e.g., vision problems, fatigue), mental (e.g., stress, distraction), or something else?

. **Seek Medical Advice**: If you're experiencing physical symptoms like dizziness, blurred vision, or fatigue, consider seeing a healthcare professional. There could be underlying health conditions that need addressing.

An organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies The study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare I lost my kids my job and all that I was an unwilling participant I no longer trust a therapist  Im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this distress. It sounds incredibly challenging and frightening to feel this way. It's important to remember that intrusive thoughts and feelings of having thoughts ""implanted"" can sometimes occur in certain mental health conditions, and seeking help from a mental health professional can be an important step in understanding what you're experiencing and finding ways to cope.

Here are a few suggestions:

. **Reach Out for Support**: Consider finding support from friends, family, or support groups. Having a network of people who understand and can offer support can be very helpful.

. **Consider a Different Approach to Therapy**: It's understandable that you're hesitant to trust a therapist or try hypnosis. However, not all therapy is the same, and there are different approaches that might feel safer or more comfortable for you. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for example, focuses on changing thought patterns and behaviors and does not involve hypnosis.

. **Express Your Concerns**: If you decide to see a mental health professional, express your concerns and what you've been through. Being open about your fears can help the therapist tailor their approach to ensure you feel safe.

. **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques**: Practicing mindfulness or grounding techniques can sometimes help in managing intrusive thoughts and feelings. These methods can help keep you focused on the present and reduce anxiety.

. **Educate Yourself**: Sometimes understanding more about mental health conditions and the brain can help make sense of what's happening. If you're interested, you might want to explore educational resources about mental well-being.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and seeking help is a strong and positive step forward. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be beneficial to reach out to mental health crisis lines or support services available in your area. They can provide immediate assistance and guidance."
"Im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend At the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart He is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but I dont really believe him 

Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves 

He knows that I still crush on him He doesnt rub it in my face Hes a good guy but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us How do I do that when the time comes How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up How do I make him feel better He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which I think is ridiculous","It's really mature of you to want to support your friend, especially when you still have feelings for him. Here are some ways you can help Tim through this situation:

. **Be a Listening Ear:** Sometimes the best support you can offer is simply being there to listen. Let Tim know you're available to talk whenever he needs to, without judgment.

. **Offer Perspective:** Gently remind him that while relationships ending can be painful, it's a normal part of growing up and that many people go through similar experiences. Reassure him that feelings of love and loss are valid and part of life, but also that these feelings can change and grow over time.

. **Encourage Open Communication:** Suggest that he talk openly with Sally about his feelings and concerns. Encouraging honest communication between them might help them both understand what they want and what’s best for them.

. **Focus on the Present:** Encourage Tim to enjoy the time he has with Sally now, rather than worrying too much about the future. This can help relieve some anxiety about the inevitable changes ahead.

. **Support His Decision:** Whether he decides to continue the relationship or end it, support his decision. Remind him that he knows what’s best for him and that whatever he chooses will contribute to personal growth.

. **Remind Him of Other Joys:** Encourage him to engage in activities he enjoys or try new things. This could help distract him and remind him of other pleasures in life outside of relationships.

. **Be Honest About Your Feelings (if appropriate):** If it feels right and won’t add pressure, you might let him know your feelings haven’t changed but emphasize that your priority is his happiness and emotions right now.

. **Stay Patient and Respect Boundaries:** Give him the space he needs to process his emotions while subtly letting him know you’re there when he needs someone to lean on.

. **Remind Him of Future Possibilities:** People often meet many potential partners throughout life. Encourage him to be open-minded about future relationships, even if he doesn't feel that way right now.

Ultimately, being a supportive friend and putting his needs first will demonstrate your care for him. It’s okay to have hopes for your friendship to develop into something more, but focusing on friendship first will benefit both of you emotionally."
Ive been struggling with it for a test and Im starting to believe its something mental What could it be,"It's possible that your struggles with the test could be related to a few different mental factors. Here are some possibilities to consider:

. **Test Anxiety**: This is quite common and can significantly impact performance. Symptoms can include nervousness, worry, and difficulty concentrating. Mindfulness, relaxation techniques, and proper preparation can help mitigate it.

. **Stress**: High stress levels from school, work, or personal life can make it challenging to focus and retain information. Good time management, self-care, and stress reduction techniques like exercise or meditation may help.

. **Lack of Confidence**: Sometimes, not believing in your ability to succeed can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Building confidence through positive affirmations and small successes can make a big difference.

. **Attention Difficulties**: If you find it hard to maintain concentration during both study and test-taking, it might be worth exploring whether conditions like ADHD could be a factor.

. **Perfectionism**: If you're overly critical of yourself or set unrealistically high standards, it can make tests more daunting than they need to be. Learning to set realistic goals and accept imperfections can be beneficial.

. **Burnout**: Overextending yourself with too much work and not enough rest can lead to burnout, making it hard to perform well in tests. Ensure you're taking breaks and prioritizing downtime.

. **Learning Style Mismatch**: Sometimes the way information is presented doesn't align with your preferred learning style. Identifying whether you're a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner and adapting study methods to suit can be helpful.

If any of these sound familiar, consider reaching out to a mentor, counselor, or mental health professional for targeted advice and support. They can provide strategies specifically tailored to your situation."

. **Open Communication:** If possible, have an open and honest conversation with the father about your feelings and needs. Understanding his perspective may help, but make sure to express how his actions impact you and the baby.

. **Set Boundaries:** If he wants time to mature and explore other relationships, you should set clear boundaries regarding your involvement and expectations. This might help prevent further emotional distress.

"I have a relative who is in his twenties  He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again No one informed family that he was using drugs again  He subsequently overdosed and was found dead
Is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed Is there a legal case for failing to report","I'm sorry to hear about your loss. Addressing the accountability of professionals and facilities involved in your relative's care involves examining various legal and professional standards. While I can provide some general insights, consulting with a legal professional who specializes in such cases is essential for understanding the specifics relevant to your situation. Here are some general considerations:

. **Standard of Care**: Facilities and professionals are generally expected to provide a certain standard of care, which includes monitoring and addressing relapses appropriately. This can vary by jurisdiction and the specific policies of the facility.

. **Duty to Inform**: Some rehabilitation programs have policies about informing family members or other designated individuals of relapses, especially if the patient has given consent. The duty to inform can depend on confidentiality agreements and the patient's legal rights around privacy.

. **Legal Requirements**: The legal obligation to report relapses to family members may not be explicitly required unless there is a specific agreement or law mandating it. Reporting is often more about internal handling of the relapse according to professional guidelines rather than informing third parties.

. **Agreement and Consent**: The role and responsibilities of counselors, therapists, and halfway house staff may be outlined in agreements made upon entry to the program. Reviewing these documents can clarify expected actions in the event of a relapse.

. **Negligence and Liability**: Establishing a legal case would likely focus on whether there was negligence involved – in terms of failing to act according to accepted care standards – and whether this directly led to harm. Proving negligence can be complex and typically requires demonstrating that a professional duty was breached.

. **Seeking Legal Advice**: Given the complexities involved, consulting a lawyer experienced in medical malpractice or wrongful death claims would be a critical step. They can assess the specifics of your case, including any agreements, policies, or jurisdictional laws that might apply.

. **Additional Considerations**: Investigating whether there were violations of state or federal regulations concerning drug treatment facilities could provide additional pathways for accountability.

In such distressing situations, both legal and medical advice are invaluable. Consider reaching out to organizations that provide support for families affected by substance use disorders for further guidance."
I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to I never fully meet what they want I feel that when I finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me,"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's tough to feel like you're not meeting others' expectations. Here are a few things that might help:

. **Communication**: Try to have open conversations with the people you're working with or for. Ask for clear expectations and feedback on what can be improved. They might not realize how you're feeling and could offer support or clarification.

. **Self-Reflection**: Consider what specifically makes you feel like you're not meeting expectations. Is it something specific they're saying or doing, or is it more about your own perception of the situation?

. **Feedback**: Seek constructive feedback actively. This can help you understand where there might be gaps and work on them before a task is completed. 

. **Self-Compassion**: Remember that nobody performs perfectly all the time, and it's okay to make mistakes or not be perfect. Be kind to yourself and acknowledge your efforts and strengths.

. **Boundaries**: If you feel overwhelmed by requests or the pressure to please, it might be helpful to set some boundaries. It's important to take care of your own mental well-being too.

. **Talk to Someone**: Sometimes, talking to a friend, family member, or mental health professional can provide new perspectives and support.

Change often starts with small steps. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on learning and growing from each experience."

Dealing with PTSD, panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and depression can be overwhelming, and it's important to know that you're not alone and there is help available.

Here are some steps you can consider:

. **Professional Support**: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist, who has experience with PTSD. They can offer therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), or other evidence-based treatments that have been effective for many people.

. **Self-Care Practices**: Establish a routine that includes regular physical exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or yoga, can also help in managing stress and improving mental well-being.

. **Stress Management**: Explore stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery to help reduce anxiety and panic symptoms.

. **Support Network**: Connecting with support groups or online communities for individuals with PTSD may provide a sense of understanding and support.

. **Apologize and Forgive**: If you’ve said or done things that were hurtful, offer a sincere apology. Be open to forgiving her as well, if she apologizes, to pave the way for healing.

Improving such a complex relationship can take time and effort, but small positive changes can gradually lead to a healthier and more supportive relationship."

. **Limit Substance Use**: Try to reduce your use of alcohol and marijuana, recognizing that while they might offer short-term relief, they can exacerbate feelings of depression or anxiety over time. If quitting or cutting down feels overwhelming, seek support from friends or professionals.

. **Remember Your Friend**: Finding ways to honor your friend’s memory can be healing. This might include writing about your memories, creating a small memorial, or participating in suicide awareness or prevention events.

. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Grieving is a personal process that takes time. Allow yourself to feel a wide range of emotions and recognize that healing isn’t linear.

Managing type  diabetes along with emotional and attachment issues can be difficult for everyone involved. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

. **Understanding Type  Diabetes:** Living with type  diabetes is a significant life change that can be overwhelming. It requires constant monitoring and management, which can be stressful, especially for someone who was only recently diagnosed. This stress might contribute to her emotional reactions and attachment issues.

. **Attachment and Change:** A new home means changes in environment and routine, which can be upsetting, especially for someone who may already feel a lack of control due to their medical condition. It's possible that her anger and demands to return to the previous home are expressions of her fear and discomfort with change.

Understanding the specific reasons behind her attachment to the prior home might provide insights that can help address her concerns.

How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has Ive read about this online but Id like to understand this from a therapists point of view,"Therapists use a variety of methods and frameworks to assess and classify a client's personality. These methodologies often rely on both clinical interviews and standardized assessment tools. Here are some key aspects therapists consider when identifying personality types or characteristics:

. **Clinical Interviews**: Through in-depth conversations, therapists gather information about a client's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and past experiences. This helps in understanding the client's worldview and interpersonal functioning.

. **Behavioral Observation**: Therapists pay close attention to how clients behave and interact during sessions, as well as their nonverbal cues. This includes noting the client's demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.

. **Personality Inventories and Assessments**: Tools like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R), or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) may be used to assess personality traits and types.

. **Diagnostic Criteria**: For clinical purposes, especially in diagnosing personality disorders, therapists reference criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-). Each personality disorder has a specific set of criteria related to long-term patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience.

. **Trait Theory**: Many therapists utilize trait theories, such as the Five-Factor Model (also known as the Big Five), which includes openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These traits are considered relatively stable over time and can provide a comprehensive picture of personality.

. **Psychodynamic Perspective**: Some therapists, particularly those trained in psychodynamic theories, will explore unconscious processes, early childhood experiences, and internal conflicts to understand personality.

. **Interpersonal Style**: Therapists often consider how clients relate to others, including attachment style, social skills, and the ability to form and maintain relationships.

. **Cognitive and Emotional Patterns**: They look at how clients process information and regulate emotions. This includes understanding habitual thought patterns, coping mechanisms, and emotional responses.

. **Cultural and Contextual Factors**: A client's cultural background and the context in which they live are also vital factors that influence personality and should be considered during assessment.

Ultimately, assessing personality is a complex and nuanced process. Therapists aim to understand the unique aspects of each individual, rather than trying to fit them into a rigid personality type. This understanding helps tailor therapeutic approaches to meet each client's specific needs."

"On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs  I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest 

How do I fix this","It sounds like you're feeling caught in a tricky situation, but it's important to remember that you’re not alone in dealing with body image concerns, and there are ways to address this. Here are a few steps you might consider:

. **Be Honest with Yourself**: Recognize that everyone develops at their own pace, and feeling pressure to look a certain way is very common. Accepting your body as it is can help you feel more confident.

. **Talk to Your Friends**: If you're comfortable, consider having an honest conversation with your friends. True friends will be understanding and supportive. You can explain that you felt pressured to look a certain way but that you want to be more authentic moving forward.

. **Build Confidence**: Focus on other traits and qualities that make you unique and wonderful. Confidence comes from being true to yourself, and people are often attracted to others' personalities more than their appearances.

. **Limit Comparisons**: Try to avoid comparing yourself to others. Social media and peer pressure can sometimes make it seem like there’s a ""right"" way to look, but everyone's body is different.

. **Seek Support**: If you feel comfortable, talk to a trusted adult, like a family member, teacher, or counselor. They can provide support and advice.

Remember, it’s totally normal to feel self-conscious about your appearance, and many people go through similar experiences. Being authentic and embracing who you are can often lead to more fulfilling friendships and a happier self-image."

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked I dont know why I feel like this Does this mean there is something wrong with me","Feeling upset and panicked about this situation may be related to a few factors, and it's important to acknowledge your feelings and consider why you might be experiencing them. Here are a few possibilities:

. **Regret or Guilt**: You might be feeling guilty or regretful about harming the frog. These feelings can arise because you recognize that the action was wrong or unnecessary.

"Im a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings 

My mood will be really high and Ill think of something that I want to do When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene Then if the thing I wanted to do doesnt work out I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out 

Can you explain whats going on","Experiencing intense mood swings as a teenager can be quite common due to the many changes happening in your life and body. Adolescence is a time of significant physical, emotional, and psychological development, and these changes can affect mood and behavior.

Here are a few possible explanations for what you might be experiencing:

. **Hormonal Changes:** During the teenage years, your body goes through hormonal changes that can affect mood and emotions. These fluctuations can lead to periods of feeling very high energy or motivation and then swinging to feelings of frustration or irritation.

. **Individual Differences:** Everyone has different personality traits and coping mechanisms. You might be particularly sensitive to external feedback or have a strong personal desire for control, which can lead to irritation when others intervene.

. **Cognitive Development:** As your brain continues to develop, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control, you might find that emotions can feel more intense and harder to manage.

. **Identity Formation:** Teenagers are often in the process of figuring out who they are and what they want, which can lead to increased emotional responses as you explore different interests and ideas.

. **Stress and Environment:** Consider other factors such as school pressure, social relationships, or personal expectations that might be contributing to the intensity of your emotions.

If you find that your mood swings are overwhelming, significantly impact your daily life, or lead to conflicts with others, it might be helpful to talk to someone about it. Speaking with a trusted adult, counselor, or therapist can provide support and strategies to help you manage these feelings more effectively."
I know Im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make  I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life but I just cant seem to even though I really want to Why cant I force myself to change,"It's not uncommon to feel stuck even when you're aware that change is necessary. Understanding why this happens can be the first step toward making the changes you desire. Here are a few things to consider:

. **Habits and Routines**: Habits are deeply ingrained and can be difficult to alter. They become automatic responses, and breaking them requires conscious effort and time.

. **Fear of Change**: Change brings uncertainty, and it's natural to fear the unknown. Even if you're not satisfied with your current situation, it might feel safer than stepping into unfamiliar territory.

. **Lack of Clarity**: Sometimes, the desire to change is vague, and without a clear vision or plan, it can be hard to take action. Defining your goals more specifically can help guide your efforts.

. **Emotional Barriers**: Emotional issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression can hinder your ability to make changes. These need to be addressed alongside efforts to change behavior.

. **Overwhelm**: Trying to change too much at once can be overwhelming. It might be more effective to start with one small, manageable change and build from there.

. **Lack of Support**: Having a supportive network can make a significant difference. Friends, family, or professional help can provide encouragement and accountability.

. **Cognitive Dissonance**: This is the discomfort experienced when holding two conflicting thoughts. You might want change but also have beliefs that contradict taking the necessary steps.

Here are some suggestions to help you move forward:

- **Set Small Goals**: Break your desired changes into small, achievable steps. Celebrate each small victory to build momentum.

- **Visualize Success**: Spend time imagining how your life will be once you've made the changes. This can motivate you to take action.

- **Find Your Motivation**: Reflect on why change is important to you. Strong motivations can propel you forward even when it's difficult.

- **Seek Professional Help**: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through emotional barriers and develop strategies for change.

- **Build a Routine**: Introduce new habits gradually into your daily routine. Consistency can help solidify new behaviors.

- **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be patient and kind with yourself. Change is often a slow process, and setbacks are a natural part of it.

Remember, change is possible, but it often takes time and persistence. Start where you are, and try not to be too hard on yourself during the process."

It's clear that both of you may be experiencing a lot of emotions right now. Here are a few steps that might help you navigate this situation:

. **Open Lines of Communication**: Even if your daughter refuses to talk to you directly, try to keep the lines of communication open. This might mean sending her messages that show you care and are willing to listen whenever she's ready.

. **Reflect on the Past**: Since your daughter mentioned remembering things from the past, it might help to reflect on what these issues might be. Try to understand her perspective and consider whether there are specific events or behaviors that might have contributed to her feelings.

"My boyfriend shows affection but I just push him away  Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me I almost always push him away Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive 

 I love him so much  Why do I do this","It sounds like you're going through a challenging time, and it's great that you're reflecting on your feelings and behaviors. There could be several reasons for your reactions, and understanding them might help you find a way forward.

. **Birth Control Side Effects**: As you've mentioned, birth control can impact libido, and this might be affecting your desire for physical affection. It's important to remember that everyone's body reacts differently to hormonal contraception. You might want to consult with your doctor to discuss your symptoms and explore other options that might have fewer side effects on your sex drive.

. **Emotional and Mental Factors**: Sometimes, emotional or mental health factors can influence our reactions to physical affection. Stress, anxiety, or past experiences can impact how we respond to a partner's touch.

. **Communication**: It's crucial to communicate openly with your boyfriend about what you're experiencing. Let him know that your reaction is not a reflection of how you feel about him but rather something you're working through. This can help prevent misunderstandings and strengthen your connection.

. **Self-Reflection**: Spend some time reflecting on whether there are any underlying issues affecting your relationship or your personal feelings. Journaling or speaking with a therapist or counselor might help you uncover and address any deeper concerns.

"My husband and I had our first threesome recently Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me 

He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now Im craving more of it But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling Why am I feeling this way","Navigating new experiences in a relationship, especially those involving intimacy, can bring up a complex mix of emotions. Here are a few reasons you might be feeling this way:

. **Jealousy and Insecurity:** Even though you might intellectually understand and be okay with the situation, feelings of jealousy or insecurity may still arise. It’s natural to compare the attention given to each person, and this can lead to feelings of being left out or undervalued.

. **Vulnerability:** Opening up your relationship to new dynamics can feel emotionally risky and make you feel vulnerable. This can lead to feelings of emptiness or uncertainty as you process these emotions.

. **Fear of Change:** Engaging in experiences that diverge from your usual dynamic can create fears about what this means for your relationship long-term. It’s normal to wonder about the impacts on your primary relationship, even if those fears are unfounded.

. **Need for Reassurance:** You may need more reassurance and validation from your husband to feel more secure in your relationship after such experiences. Conversations about boundaries, feelings, and expectations can be crucial.

. **Complex Emotions:** It’s also possible to have conflicting feelings, such as excitement and anxiety, coexisting. This internal conflict can manifest as an empty feeling before the experience.

. **Processing Experience:** Sometimes, the aftermath of a new, intense experience can leave you feeling emotionally drained as you work through your thoughts and feelings about it.

Consider discussing these feelings with your husband if you haven't already. Open communication can help both of you understand and address each other's needs and concerns, setting clear boundaries and expectations for future experiences. If these feelings persist or become overwhelming, seeking the support of a relationship counselor might provide additional guidance and perspective."

"I love my girlfriend so much I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her  But the two times we tried to have sex I couldnt get an erection  Weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago 

Why this is happening and what can I do about it","It sounds like you're experiencing a form of erectile dysfunction (ED) that might be related to psychological factors, rather than a physiological issue, especially since you get erections when thinking about or seeing your girlfriend. This can be relatively common, and there are several possible reasons this might be happening:

. **Performance Anxiety:** Sometimes, the pressure to perform well, especially if you've had a gap since the last time you had sex, can cause anxiety that affects your ability to get an erection.

. **Stress and Anxiety:** General stress, whether it's related to work, life, or your relationship, can also impact erectile function.

Here are some steps you might consider taking to address this issue:

. **Communicate with Your Partner:** Talk openly with your girlfriend about what's happening. It's important she understands it's a common issue and not a reflection of your attraction to or feelings for her.

. **Reduce Pressure:** Try to shift the focus from penetrative sex to other forms of intimacy, such as kissing, touching, or oral sex. This can help reduce pressure and create a more relaxed and enjoyable experience.

. **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage stress and anxiety.

Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this,"Yes, it's completely normal to feel nervous and shaky when attending therapy sessions, especially in the early stages. Therapy often involves discussing personal and sometimes difficult topics, which can naturally lead to feelings of anxiety. It takes time to build a comfortable relationship with your therapist and get accustomed to the process. As you continue attending sessions, these feelings should lessen as you become more familiar with the environment and your therapist. In the meantime, it might be helpful to communicate your feelings to your therapist. They can provide support and strategies to help you feel more at ease."

How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time","Improving communication in a relationship can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can try to encourage your husband to listen more effectively:

. **Ask for Feedback:** Encourage him to share his thoughts about the conversation or ask if he understands how you feel, fostering a two-way dialogue rather than a one-sided discussion.

. **Model the Behavior:** Continue to demonstrate good listening skills yourself. Over time, he might reflect on this and incorporate similar habits into how he communicates with you.

"We rent from from my boyfriends parents His father drops by unannounced and stays for long periods of time He lets himself into our home when we arent there on a daily basis and takes our dogs to his house He picks up our mail He has NO boundaries 

Hes an opinionated rude pushy person He expects to spend every weekend around us gives unsolicited advice on child rearing and does not respect our privacy at all He barges in with no warning He has a key and lets himself into our house without asking permission I need help How do I address this","Dealing with a situation where boundaries are being violated, especially by a family member, can be challenging but addressing it is important for maintaining a healthy living environment. Here are some steps you can take:

. **Communicate with Your Boyfriend**: Start by having an honest conversation with your boyfriend. It's important that both of you are on the same page about the boundary issues with his father. Discuss your feelings and agree on what boundaries need to be set.

. **Prepare for the Conversation**: Before addressing the issue with his father, think about what specific boundaries you want to set. Be clear about things like not entering the house without permission, taking the dogs, or picking up your mail. Write these down if it helps.

. **Have a Direct Conversation**: Arrange a time to talk to his father directly, preferably with your boyfriend present. Be calm and respectful, but assertive. Use ""I"" statements to express how his actions make you feel, for example, ""I feel uncomfortable when you enter the house without letting us know.""

. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Clearly articulate the boundaries you're setting. For example, you might say that you appreciate his visits but need advanced notice or would prefer he not take the dogs without asking.

. **Reclaim Your Key**: If possible, ask for the key back. If returning the key is a difficult conversation, consider changing the locks as a last resort, but be prepared to discuss why this step was necessary.

. **Suggest Alternatives**: Offer alternatives that make both parties comfortable. Maybe set a specific day for family visits or suggest that he calls ahead if he wants to drop by.

. **Stay Consistent**: Once boundaries are set, it's crucial to stick to them. If his father oversteps again, remind him of the conversation and the boundaries agreed upon.

. **Seek Mediation**: If direct conversations don't work, consider seeking help from a family therapist or mediator who can facilitate a constructive dialogue.

. **Look into Housing Options**: If the situation doesn't improve and affects your mental well-being, you might want to discuss with your boyfriend the possibility of moving to another location.

Setting boundaries with family can be tough, but it's important for your peace of mind and to establish a sense of respect and privacy in your home."
"My mother is combative with me when I say I dont want to talk with her about my depression  

She hasnt been supportive of me in the past and she isnt someone that I feel comfortable opening up to She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I dont want to or cant answer I tell her I dont want to talk and she starts arguments with me 

How can I get her to understand","Navigating a situation where a parent is not supportive or understanding of your mental health needs can be challenging and emotionally taxing. Here are some strategies that may help you communicate your boundaries and needs more effectively with your mother:

. **Set Clear Boundaries:** Calmly explain your need for boundaries in conversations about your mental health. You might say, “I understand you want to help, but talking about my depression isn’t helpful for me right now.”

. **Use “I” Statements:** These can help reduce defensiveness in conversations. For example, “I feel overwhelmed when we talk about my depression. I need some space to manage it in my own way.”

. **Limit Interaction Time:** If conversations with your mother consistently lead to arguments, limit the time you spend engaging in these discussions. You can politely but firmly end conversations that are heading in that direction.

. **Provide Alternative Ways to Help:** Sometimes people push because they want to help but don’t know how. You could suggest specific ways she can support you, such as helping with daily tasks or simply spending quality time together without discussing depression.

. **Seek Professional Guidance:** If possible, consider working with a therapist to develop strategies for communicating with your mother. They can offer advice tailored to your situation and help you manage your feelings and stress.

. **Involve a Mediator:** If you’re comfortable, involve a trusted family member or professional who can mediate a conversation between you and your mother. They can help communicate your needs more neutrally.

. **Share Educational Material:** Sometimes people have misconceptions about mental health that can be corrected with information. If she’s open to it, share articles, books, or documentaries that explain depression and the importance of respecting boundaries.

. **Practice Self-Care:** Make sure you’re prioritizing your own well-being. Surround yourself with supportive people, and engage in activities that help you manage stress and boost your mood.

Remember, you can’t control your mother’s reactions, but you can control how you respond and set limits to protect your mental health."
